<p class="content">
<br>A Better Way to Learn English
<br>If you’ve picked up this book, chances are you’ve wanted to speak English for a
<br>while. Maybe you’ve even taken classes. You probably need English to improve
<br>your career. Maybe you want to travel internationally or study abroad. You know
<br>that English is the key to international business and international travel. So let me
<br>ask you something.
<br>Do you feel nervous or shy when you try to speak English? Do you still struggle
<br>to understand what someone is saying to you despite years of study? Are you
<br>embarrassed about your pronunciation or worried you speak too slowly? Are you
<br>frustrated that despite all the time you’ve invested in learning English you still can’t
<br>speak it? Despite your goals, is it difficult for you to actually use English in your
<br>job, travels, or studies? Do you sometimes feel that you’ll never master spoken
<br>English?
<br>If you answered yes to any of these questions, you’re not alone. In fact, you’re
<br>fairly typical. Most English students feel this way. Most adult English learners are
<br>stressed and frustrated about their speaking ability. Some feel completely hopeless
<br>and feel they’ll never be able to speak English powerfully. Not because they’re bad
<br>at languages, but because, like you, they’ve been taught using the wrong methods.
<br>The good thing is that it doesn’t have to be like this. There is nothing wrong with
<br>you. You can learn to speak English naturally and with ease. You can use English
<br>effectively in your job, travels, and studies. You can feel relaxed and confident
<br>every time you speak English. In fact, as a long-time English teacher, I’ve helped
<br>thousands of students all over the world become fluent and powerful English
<br>speakers.
<br>How did I do it? I did it using a teaching method I developed called Effortless
<br>English™. Effortless English™ enables you to learn English naturally and
<br>automatically – the way children learn before they enter school. Too often, English
<br>classes get so focused on tests, textbooks, grades and “levels,” students forget why
<br>they’re there in the first place. They forget about the real world goals of a more
<br>successful career and exciting international travel. With Effortless English™ you
<br>never lose sight of the fact that the ultimate goal of learning a language is
<br>communication. Instead, you learn to speak English both quickly and with more
<br>precision.
<br>Effortless?
<br>I understand if you’re skeptical – particularly if you’ve been trying to learn English
<br>the traditional way. You’ve put in the hours: memorizing vocabulary lists, doing
<br>grammar drills, reading boring textbooks. “How?” you’re thinking, “can speaking
<br>English possibly be effortless?”
<br>Believe me, I feel your pain.
<br>Back when I started teaching 15 years ago, my students were all excited to begin
<br>conversing in English. And I was excited to help them. At that time, I taught in the
<br>usual way. I used textbooks and I focused on teaching grammar. I thought this was
<br>the best way to teach, and none of my students complained.
<br>I still remember one particularly intelligent student of mine from Venezuela
<br>named Gladys. Gladys was determined to speak English well. Talk about effort!
<br>Gladys attended every one of my classes. She always sat in the center of the front
<br>ow. I can still picture her eager and smiling face. She took detailed notes. She
<br>listened to every word I said. She also studied at home. Every day Gladys studied
<br>her English textbooks for four hours or more. She also tried to learn 50 new
<br>vocabulary words by memorizing word lists. Gladys was my star student and I, too,
<br>was sure she would succeed.
<br>Six months later, however, she still could barely speak English. Her speech was
<br>hesitant and unnatural. She constantly made grammar mistakes with even the
<br>simplest sentences. Her pronunciation was difficult to understand. She still thought
<br>in Spanish and tried to translate to and from English when she spoke. Worst of all,
<br>Gladys felt nervous every time she tried to speak English. Speaking English was a
<br>painful experience for her.
<br>Gladys was extremely frustrated. After so much effort, she had barely improved.
<br>As her teacher, I too was frustrated. I was sure Gladys would improve quickly and
<br>couldn’t understand why she had not. I followed all of the traditional teaching
<br>methods. I used the standard textbooks and the standard classroom activities. Gladys
<br>was intelligent, disciplined and consistent, and yet her English speaking barely
<br>improved.
<br>Sadly, I realized that Gladys wasn’t the only one who had not improved. Her
<br>classmates also had barely improved. It was frustrating, and I felt like a complete
<br>failure as a teacher. But when I asked my colleagues for help, it turned out they had
<br>the same problem – very few of their students were improving either! At that point,
<br>I realized something was wrong – something is wrong with standard methods for
<br>teaching English. The worst part for me was that everyone accepted this situation as
<br>“normal.” The other teachers didn’t seem to be concerned about their students’ lack
<br>of progress. All the teachers were using the same methods and getting the same
<br>poor results.
<br>In most parts of the world, students study English in school for years. Yet, the vast
<br>majority of them never learn to speak English well. After years of study, they still
<br>have trouble with real English conversations. They still feel nervous and shy about
<br>speaking.
<br>A few years after my experience with Gladys, I got a job as an English teaching
<br>assistant in Japan. I was excited and eager to help these young students learn my
<br>language. I still remember my first day. I was sitting at the front of the class next to
<br>the main teacher, who was Japanese. As the students came into the room, they saw
<br>me and giggled nervously. They sat down and continued to shyly glance up at me.
<br>They were sweet and curious.
<br>Then the class started. The main teacher wrote an English sentence on the board. I
<br>don’t remember the exact sentence, but it was something like, “The little girl goes to
<br>school.” The teacher pointed to the sentence and began to talk in Japanese. The
<br>students all grabbed their notebooks and began writing. Everyone was very serious.
<br>Next, the teacher circled the word “goes.” She pointed at the word and continued
<br>speaking in Japanese. She talked and talked and talked, in Japanese. The students
<br>wrote quickly, filling their notebooks with information. Finally, the teacher drew a
<br>line from the word “goes” to the word “girl.” And then she talked more, on and on
<br>and on, in Japanese.
<br>This continued for the entire class. The teacher drew lines, circles, and squares.
<br>She used different colored chalk. And she continued speaking Japanese.
<br>I was totally confused. I am a native speaker of English, and I was sitting in a
<br>beginning English class. Yet I could not understand anything in the class (except for
<br>that one sentence). I was thinking to myself, “What could this teacher possibly be
<br>talking about so much? It’s just one sentence.” Yet the teacher spent an entire hour
<br>analyzing, explaining, and dissecting that one simple sentence. Finally, at the end of
<br>the class, the teacher asked me to read the sentence aloud “for pronunciation.” I read
<br>the sentence a couple of times, and that was the only real English input the students
<br>got that day.
<br>Sadly, this same pattern repeated every day. Day by day, I watched the students’
<br>enthusiasm and curiosity disappear. They became bored. They became stressed and
<br>confused. Every day they wrote pages of notes, mostly in Japanese. Every day the
<br>teacher talked and talked and talked, mostly in Japanese. I couldn’t understand why
<br>an English class was being taught mostly in Japanese. During the average class, the
<br>students were listening to Japanese 90% of the time or more. They heard very little
<br>English. No wonder they never learned to speak! No wonder they were frustrated
<br>and confused.
<br>Honestly, it broke my heart to watch as the school crushed these students’ natural
<br>love of learning. It was terrible to watch them grow bored, frustrated, and stressed.
<br>And six months later, none of the students could speak to me at all, not even the
<br>simplest conversation. This kind of situation is repeated in English classes all over
<br>the world.
<br>My experiences with Gladys and in Japan convinced me that traditional English
<br>language education is broken. I knew there had to be a better way to help my
<br>students speak English than what we were doing. So I began the search for a better
<br>way. I devoured books about English teaching. I constantly tried out new methods
<br>in my classes. I read research studies. I traveled and taught English in other parts of
<br>the world.
<br>What surprised me was how little the actual research supported traditional
<br>teaching methods. As eminent University of Southern California linguist Stephen
<br>Krashen noted: “We acquire language when we understand what people tell us and
<br>what we read….there is no need for deliberate memorization.” If most of us knew,
<br>intuitively, that the best way to learn English was naturally, I wondered, why were so
<br>many teachers and students still choosing to use unnatural, ineffective and old
<br>methods of teaching?
<br>Eventually, I went back to school and got a master ’s degree in (TESOL) Teaching
<br>English to Speakers of Other Languages. Along the way, I did more research and
<br>discovered the incredible new methods that would become the basis for the
<br>Effortless English™ program.
<br>I also did my own informal research. I searched for excellent English speakers
<br>who had learned the language as an adult. Whenever I found such a person, I
<br>interviewed them. Over time, I noticed patterns. Most of these successful speakers
<br>were independent students who mastered spoken English outside of school. Most of
<br>them used similar methods, the very same methods supported by my master ’s
<br>esearch. Most avoided the traditional methods used in most schools.
<br>I changed my teaching, and when I used these new strategies in classes, my
<br>students improved quickly. I couldn’t believe it! They learned to speak easily and
<br>powerfully. And even better – they were enjoying themselves! After years of
<br>searching and experimentation, I had finally found methods that worked.
<br>Effortless English Today
<br>Over the years, I’ve continued to test and adapt these methods and developed the
<br>Effortless English™ system. I’ve organized the program to include seven essential
<br>ules for learning English, which have led countless students to fluency. To build on
<br>the success of my classes, I created audio courses and began offering them online to
<br>English students around the world. My audio lessons are currently bestsellers in 25
<br>countries.
<br>In addition, I founded the Effortless English Club™ to create an international
<br>English learning community where students can communicate with other members. I
<br>wanted to create an environment that encouraged confidence and success with
<br>English, because so many learners struggle with nervousness, shyness, frustration
<br>and fear when speaking. In fact, for many people these negative emotions are the
<br>worst part of speaking English.
<br>In our Effortless English Club™ students are able to interact on our forums and
<br>speak with each other online. It is an extremely positive and encouraging
<br>community, where everyone is free to “play with English,” make mistakes, and
<br>communicate without fear. In my opinion, we have the best members in the world.
<br>Every one of our members is focused not only on their own success, but also on
<br>helping other members achieve success too. The result is a supportive “family” of
<br>learners and international leaders.
<br>This book is another resource for students looking to speak English powerfully
<br>and fluently. It is designed to guide you on the road to fluency, to speed your
<br>journey to confident, powerful, effortless speaking. In this book, you will learn how
<br>to re-program your negative emotions about English, develop confidence when
<br>speaking, and follow a powerful and effective road to fluency. You’ll also learn how
<br>to use English to improve your career and achieve the success you want.
<br>Over the next several chapters, I will describe the Effortless English™ system in
<br>detail, explain the philosophy behind it, and tell you why both psychology and
<br>method are important for language learning. I’ll also tell you exactly how to use the
<br>system to reach your goals.
<br>Join me and enjoy the journey. You really have nothing to fear by leaving the old
<br>education system behind. So let go of the pressure, the stress, the fear and the
<br>boredom. I promise you this natural learning system is fun, friendly, and energetic –
<br>the opposite of most school classrooms. There is no pressure – just friendly
<br>encouragement and support.
<br>Trust me. I have helped students everywhere in the world… and now I am eager to
<br>help you. I promise I will always do my best to help you speak excellent English.
<br>NOT "LAZY" ENGLISH
<br>So what is Effortless English™? By "effortless" I certainly don't mean lazy
<br>English. On the contrary, "effortless English" is going to be the result of the work
<br>you put in every day. By following my system, you will make progress and
<br>achieve the result of speaking naturally and "effortlessly" (unforced, without
<br>stress, hesitation or nervousness).
<br>In other words, "effortless" is the result, not the beginning. Your goal is to
<br>speak English effortlessly. You want the words to flow out without thinking,
<br>without translating, without worry or hesitation. You want to speak English just as
<br>you speak your own native language. Effortless speaking is the final result, and
<br>sometimes it takes a lot of effort to become effortless!
<br>It is possible, however, to thoroughly enjoy that effort. The example I like to
<br>use is that of an athlete or artist "in the zone." "In the zone" means performing
<br>excellently and effortlessly. When an athlete is "in the zone" at one level, they are
<br>working very hard – expending a lot of energy, pushing, totally focused.
<br>However, when they are enjoying themselves and completely focused, the activity
<br>FEELS effortless to them. There is no feeling of forcing, straining, etc.
<br>In fact, the name Effortless English™ was inspired by the Taoist idea of "wu
<br>wei" or effortless effort. It's a description of that flow state where you can be
<br>expending a lot of effort and yet it feels totally effortless and natural, not forced.
<br>So the point is that Effortless English™ is not about laziness, quick fixes, or
<br>impossible scams... but rather about finding that state of "effortless effort" or "wu
<br>wei." Effortless English means you speak English fluently. You don't struggle as
<br>you speak. You don't feel nervous or stressed. You don't think about grammar
<br>ules or translations.
<br>When you speak English effortlessly, you communicate your ideas clearly. You
<br>express your feelings powerfully. You focus on connecting with other people, not
<br>on conjugating verbs. You thoroughly enjoy the process of speaking English as
<br>you work, travel and learn.
<br>CHAPTER 2
<br>The Problem with Schools
<br>My teaching experiences in different parts of the world convinced me that
<br>something is wrong with English education. Everywhere I went, it was the same
<br>situation. The students were bored, frustrated, stressed, and nervous. Most students,
<br>even after years of studying English, failed to speak the language fluently. You are
<br>not alone, because it’s a global problem.
<br>One of my students, Seiko from Japan, described this combination of failure and
<br>stress as “English trauma.” Seiko said that she hated English. She felt that learning
<br>English was boring and stressful and speaking English was even worse. In fact, the
<br>thought of speaking to a native speaker immediately made Seiko feel extremely
<br>nervous and shy. Seiko felt she had developed a psychological problem with
<br>English and had named it “English trauma.” A “trauma” is a deep wound or injury.
<br>“How sad,” I thought to myself, “that so many people now think of English as a kind
<br>of injury or mental disease.”
<br>Throughout my teaching career I’ve met many students who had similar feelings
<br>about English. I discovered that Seiko was not alone. Rather, “English trauma” is a
<br>global epidemic. Though most people feel they must learn to speak English, very
<br>few seem to enjoy it. Most who learn the language struggle with the same feelings
<br>of nervousness and frustration that Seiko had.
<br>As I encountered this problem more and more, I began to look for the root
<br>causes. I realized that before I found a solution, I needed to understand the problem.
<br>Just as a doctor must first diagnose a disease before treating it. Think about it. What
<br>is the cause of all this misery and failure? Why do so many people fail to speak
<br>English effortlessly despite years of study? What is wrong with English education?
<br>The first and most obvious problem I found with schools was the way in which
<br>they teach English. Most schools, everywhere in the world, use the grammar
<br>translation method. As the name implies, the focus of this method is on grammar
<br>analysis and the memorization of translated vocabulary. This method breaks English
<br>into an endless series of grammar formulas to memorize. Of course, each grammar
<br>formula has exceptions and these must be memorized too.
<br>Schools like the grammar translation method because it appears to be serious,
<br>academic and complex. The grammar translation method fits the way schools teach
<br>most subjects — with textbooks, lectures, notes, memorization, and tests. The only
<br>problem, as you know, is that it doesn’t work. In real conversations, there simply is
<br>no time to think about grammar formulas and their exceptions. The failure rate for
<br>this method, therefore, is absolutely horrible. Despite the failure of most students to
<br>speak English fluently, schools continue to use this method. This is an epic failure
<br>of our education system.
<br>Recently, because students find the grammar translation method so boring, some
<br>schools have added “communication activities” to their curriculum. Occasionally,
<br>the teacher puts the students into pairs or groups. The students then read or repeat
<br>dialogues from a textbook. Sometimes they might answer a few questions from a
<br>worksheet. Of course, these activities are unnatural, nothing like real English
<br>conversation. Consequently, the failure rate of “communication activities” is just as
<br>bad as grammar translation.
<br>Obviously the English teaching methods used in schools do not work. That was
<br>easy to see. I knew it. The students knew it. And many teachers know it too, though
<br>few will admit it.
<br>However, as I continued to investigate the problem with schools, I found even
<br>deeper problems in the education system. These problems are less obvious, but in
<br>many ways far more damaging to the students. I call these problems “the hidden
<br>curriculum” because they are the hidden lessons taught by schools.
<br>The Hidden Curriculum
<br>Most schools, everywhere in the world, share a similar hidden curriculum. One
<br>element of this curriculum is student passivity. In schools, students are trained to be
<br>passive, not active. They sit in chairs, in rows. When they are young, they are told to
<br>be quiet and obey the teacher. As the teacher lectures, the students take notes. Later,
<br>they are told to memorize these notes in preparation for a test. The message is clear
<br>— learning is a passive activity. You listen to the teacher, you take notes, you
<br>memorize the notes.
<br>The problem is that speaking English is not a passive activity. You must connect
<br>with other people. You must constantly ask and answer questions. You must
<br>communicate ideas, emotions, and descriptions. You must be ready for the
<br>unexpected. You must be spontaneous. You must actively interact. English is not
<br>something you passively study, it’s something you do.
<br>Related to the problem of passivity is the issue of energy. Sitting for a long time
<br>is a low-energy activity. The longer you sit, the more your energy drops. And as
<br>your energy drops, so does your concentration. What’s worse, we know that some
<br>learners need physical movement in order to learn effectively. These people are
<br>called “kinesthetic learners.” The truth is we are all “kinesthetic learners” to some
<br>degree, because we all benefit from physical movement. Schools stick us in chairs
<br>and drain our energy. Eventually, an inactive body leads to an inactive mind.
<br>The One Right Answer Mentality
<br>One of the greatest flaws of school education is the idea of “one right answer.” One
<br>ight answer is a powerful part of the hidden curriculum. It is a result of using
<br>textbooks and tests.
<br>In school, you are frequently taught that there is one, and only one, correct
<br>answer to a question or problem. For example, you may be asked to choose the
<br>correct verb tense on a test, or you may be taught “proper” English greetings. The
<br>hidden message is that the teacher ’s way is always right.
<br>Real life, and real English, is not this way. For example, sometimes I will tell a
<br>story using the present tense, even though the events happened in the past. This is a
<br>technique commonly used by native speakers. However, when English learners hear
<br>these stories, many are confused and upset. They are convinced that the past tense is
<br>the “right answer” and the only correct way to tell the story. Some get quite upset
<br>and even argue with me about it. These students are so convinced that there is only
<br>“one right answer” that they will argue with native speakers!
<br>These students have been trained to believe that there is only one correct way to
<br>say things in English. The truth is there are always many ways to say the same thing.
<br>We can change verb tenses in order to change the feeling of the story. We can use
<br>different vocabulary and different phrases. And we even break grammar rules all
<br>the time! ‘One right answer ’ thinking limits and confuses English learners. Effective
<br>communication requires flexibility while the “one right answer” mentality trains
<br>students to be rigid and unimaginative.
<br>Connected to this problem is another dangerous part of the hidden curriculum —
<br>fear of mistakes. This is one of the most negative and traumatizing messages taught
<br>in schools. How is the fear of mistakes taught? Through tests and corrections. In
<br>nearly every school all over the world, teachers regularly give quizzes and tests.
<br>The teacher asks questions and the students must provide the one right answer. Of
<br>course, the one right answer is always the teacher ’s answer.
<br>What happens if the student provides a different answer? They are punished with a
<br>lower score. Students are smart, and they quickly understand that in school, mistakes
<br>are bad and must be avoided. They also understand that truth is unimportant and the
<br>best way to succeed is to simply give the answer that the teacher wants. Even worse
<br>is when a student, already feeling nervous, tries to speak English with the whole
<br>class listening. They are just learning, so of course they will make mistakes. When
<br>the teacher corrects these mistakes, the student is embarrassed and becomes even
<br>more nervous. Eventually, most students try to avoid speaking English because the
<br>situation is so painful.
<br>By punishing and correcting mistakes, schools punish risk taking. Little by little,
<br>they train students to avoid risk and avoid doing anything they can’t do perfectly. Yet
<br>there is no perfection with English speaking. Even native speakers make mistakes.
<br>We make grammar mistakes. We mispronounce words. We forget vocabulary
<br>words. It doesn’t matter, because we are focused on communicating, not on tests and
<br>grades.
<br>Of course, the fear of mistakes goes far beyond English class. After years of
<br>school, most people learn to avoid risk in most parts of their life. School trains
<br>them to be passive, rigid, timid, and obedient. This not only hurts your English
<br>speaking, it also harms your career and limits your success in all areas of life.
<br>Fortune favors the bold. Those who are active, flexible, and passionate are the ones
<br>who achieve the greatest success in life. The passive and obedient rarely live their
<br>dreams.
<br>You will make many mistakes as you improve your English speaking. There is no
<br>need to be upset by this. The truth is, most native speakers don’t care. They don’t
<br>care if you make grammar mistakes. They just want to communicate with you. They
<br>want to share thoughts, ideas and feelings. They want to communicate with you as a
<br>human being, not as an “English student.” To communicate effectively, you must
<br>forget the idea of perfection and learn to be flexible.
<br>The Dirty Secret of English Teaching
<br>If the hidden curriculum is so bad, why do schools and teachers continue to follow
<br>it? The truth about our education system is that the curriculum exists to benefit the
<br>schools, not the students. Teachers use these methods because they are easier for the
<br>teacher, not because they are good for the student. The hidden curriculum creates
<br>passive students. It creates obedient students. Passive and obedient students are easier
<br>to control, making life easier for teachers and school administrators.
<br>Textbooks, for example, make the teacher ’s job much easier. By using a textbook,
<br>the teacher doesn’t have to plan new lessons for every class. Planning lessons is
<br>hard work, and a textbook makes it much easier. The teacher can simply follow the
<br>textbook with minimum effort. Many teachers are little more than textbook readers.
<br>Every day they read the textbook to their students, slavishly following the lessons. In
<br>my opinion, they can barely be called “teachers” at all. Perhaps we should call them
<br>“textbook readers” instead.
<br>Another benefit of textbooks, for the schools, is that they standardize learning. By
<br>using a textbook, the school ensures that every English class is learning exactly the
<br>same thing. School officials like this because it makes testing and ranking students
<br>easier. Schools are like factories, the bosses want everything to be the same.
<br>The same is true for tests and grades. These provide little to no benefit to English
<br>learners. In fact, as we have discussed, tests and grades increase stress and create a
<br>fear of making mistakes. Tests and grades are a primary cause of “English trauma.”
<br>On the other hand, tests and grades are a powerful tool of control for teachers.
<br>When students fear bad grades, they obey the teacher more. They learn that the
<br>teacher is always right, because if they don’t agree with the teacher ’s answer they
<br>are punished with lower scores.
<br>Grades are a means of ranking students. Most teachers and administrators are
<br>focused on ranking students rather than helping all succeed. In many schools, the
<br>official policy is that a certain percentage of students in every class must get poor
<br>grades, a certain percentage must get “medium level” grades, and only a small
<br>percentage can be given excellent grades. In other words, the system is designed to
<br>create failure for a large number of students.
<br>While working at a university in Thailand, I was told directly by my boss that too
<br>many of my students had high scores. My boss insisted that I fail more students in
<br>my class. I was shocked and angry. I quit the job rather than purposely fail dedicated
<br>students. Sadly, this mentality of “designing for failure” is present in most school
<br>everywhere in the world. Schools benefit from ranking and controlling students.
<br>The grammar translation method also benefits the teacher but not the student. By
<br>teaching grammar rules, the teacher can simply lecture from the textbook. Because
<br>linguistics is a complicated subject, the teacher appears knowledgeable and thus
<br>establishes a position of superiority over the students. Even if the teacher is a nonnative
<br>speaker with terrible English ability, he or she can pretend to be an expert by
<br>teaching complex grammar from a book. The shocking truth is that many nonnative
<br>English teachers, in fact, speak English very poorly. By focusing on
<br>grammar they disguise their inability to speak well.
<br>What about communication activities? Surely they are designed to help students.
<br>Actually, they are not. These activities, as we discussed previously, are unnatural.
<br>They are nothing like a real conversation, and thus do not prepare students to have
<br>eal conversations. However, communication activities are great for teachers. The
<br>teacher puts the students into pairs or groups and asks them to follow a textbook
<br>activity. Often, the students simply read a written dialogue from the book or answer
<br>pre-written questions from the book. The advantage for the teacher is that once such
<br>an activity is started, the teacher can rest and do nothing. While the students go
<br>through the textbook activity, the teacher relaxes. It’s a secret among English
<br>teachers that communication activities are a great way to waste time and avoid work.
<br>One particularly horrible version of communication activities is the use of
<br>movies. Used correctly, movies can be a powerful English learning tool. Most
<br>teachers, however, simply use movies as a way to waste time. They put in a movie,
<br>turn out the lights, and push play. For the remainder of the class, the teacher happily
<br>does nothing. The students are usually happy, too, because watching a movie is far
<br>more interesting than grammar, even if they can’t understand most of the film.
<br>Passive Low Energy Benefits the Teacher
<br>Finally, let’s look at the low energy situation in most schools. From childhood,
<br>students are forced to sit for hours, motionless in chairs. They are told to be quiet
<br>and obedient. By adulthood, most people are thoroughly trained. They accept
<br>passive lectures and low energy as a normal part of learning.
<br>Why would schools and teachers want low energy? Again, because low energy
<br>students are easier to manage. A teacher must work much harder with curious,
<br>energetic students. Sadly, most teachers prefer the easy way. It’s much easier for
<br>them to lecture quietly to passive students.
<br>The truth is that many teachers are tired and stressed. Because of this, they
<br>constantly look for ways to make their own job easier. Their first concern is not the
<br>students. They are not obsessively focused on getting better results for the learners.
<br>Rather, they just want to get through their workday as easily as possible. There are
<br>many reasons for this situation, but the end result for the student is boredom,
<br>frustration, and poor results.
<br>This is the ugly truth of education. This is the reason you cannot speak English
<br>well, despite years of study. This is the reason you find English to be stressful,
<br>difficult, and boring. This is the cause of English trauma. This is the source of the
<br>problem.
<br>Happily, there is a solution. The Internet has made independent learning easy for
<br>all. No matter where you live or what you do, it is possible to master spoken
<br>English without schools. All you need is an Internet connection!
<br>In the next chapter, I will introduce the solution to English trauma. You will learn
<br>how to heal and how to finally get the results you want with English speaking.
<br>CHAPTER 3
<br>Psychology Is More Important
<br>Than Grammar and Vocabulary
<br>Most people have suffered with English for so long they worry there is no
<br>solution. Trained by schools to be passive, fear mistakes, and search for just one
<br>ight answer, most English learners are stressed and frustrated. Some feel nearly
<br>hopeless. They have spent years in English classrooms. They have spent years
<br>memorizing grammar rules and vocabulary lists. They have spent years studying
<br>for exams such as the TOEFL, IELTS, or TOEIC.
<br>Despite all this work and effort, most English learners are frustrated. Many
<br>struggle with even simple conversations. Many feel nervous any time they must
<br>speak English. They have memorized countless grammar rules, yet even simple
<br>conversations feel difficult. Likewise, despite years of study, most learners still
<br>cannot understand American TV or movies.
<br>After so many years of traditional learning, students are confused. When they try
<br>to speak, they constantly think about grammar and translations. First they think of a
<br>sentence in their own language, then they translate it to English, then they think
<br>about the grammar, and finally they speak.
<br>When they listen, they go through a similar process. They hear the English,
<br>translate it into their own language, think of a response in their own language,
<br>translate their response into English, and then think about the grammar to be sure
<br>their response is correct. No wonder their speech is so slow and unnatural! No
<br>wonder English feels so stressful and difficult! Real conversations are fast, and it’s
<br>nearly impossible to do all of this thinking fast enough, especially when talking to a
<br>native speaker.
<br>If you think about translations and grammar during a real conversation, you will
<br>quickly become lost. Instead of listening carefully to the other person, you’ll be
<br>translating your own responses and trying to remember grammar. Your speech will
<br>be hesitant. Often, the other person will become frustrated by your lack of
<br>understanding. Of course, if you see the other person is losing patience, you will
<br>usually become even more nervous. It’s a terrible downward spiral that most
<br>English learners know too well.
<br>There is a solution. There is a way to escape the hidden curriculum. There is a
<br>oad to English fluency and you can travel on it. You can speak English powerfully.
<br>You can speak English clearly, naturally, and effortlessly. This solution, however,
<br>will require you to completely change your beliefs about education and completely
<br>change the way you learn English.
<br>I call the solution the Effortless English™ system and it has two parts: the
<br>psychology and the method. Most schools, most teachers, and most learners focus
<br>only on method. In other words, they are solely focused on the pieces of the English
<br>language — vocabulary and grammar. As we learned in the last chapter, schools
<br>primarily use the “grammar translation” method, with some “communication
<br>activities” added.
<br>While schools are focused just on method, they completely ignore the first part of
<br>the Effortless English™ system — the psychology. Yet, psychology is probably the
<br>most important element for success with English speaking. When you think of your
<br>own English speaking, you’ll realize that your nervousness, lack of confidence, and
<br>frustration are major problems. How do you change these?
<br>Without an effective psychological system, you will struggle to find success with
<br>even the best language teaching method. Let’s use a story to understand these two
<br>important parts of the Effortless English™ system. Imagine that you are on a road.
<br>You are driving on the road to English fluency.
<br>What kind of car would you want? Let’s say all you have to drive is an old slow
<br>car that often breaks down. In addition, you fill this old car with cheap gasoline.
<br>What kind of trip will you have? How fast will you go on this road to fluency? Most
<br>likely, your trip will be slow and frustrating, with frequent breakdowns. In fact, you
<br>probably will not reach your destination.
<br>Now, you could put some high quality gas in that old car, but even then it will
<br>likely take you a long time to reach your destination. Better gas will help a little, but
<br>the trip is still likely to be slow and frustrating.
<br>Now imagine instead that you’ll be driving a Formula 1 racing car on this road to
<br>fluency. This car is made for speed and performance. Clearly, it will go faster than
<br>the old, slow car. But what if you fill it up with cheap, low quality fuel? There will
<br>likely be problems. Racing cars need racing fuel or they will not perform well.
<br>Obviously, the best situation would be to put high quality racing fuel into your
<br>Formula 1 racing car! With this car and this fuel, your trip on the road to fluency
<br>will be fast and exciting.
<br>This is how learning English works. If you’ve been studying for a while, you
<br>know by now that there are all sorts of systems. Traditional classes at universities.
<br>Private lessons from language schools. Online or packaged software courses.
<br>Immersion programs that put you in the country where they speak the language
<br>you’re studying. In other words, you’ve got a lot of different cars to choose from.
<br>Some may be better than others, some may be faster. But even the greatest of these
<br>methods, the Ferrari of language teaching, if you will, needs fuel to make it work.
<br>A method, after all, is only an engine. And if you don’t give an engine the proper
<br>fuel, even a great one won’t work the way you’d like it to. To succeed, you need
<br>both quality fuel and a powerful engine.
<br>The right engine + the right fuel = success
<br>Obviously, I believe the right engine would be the Effortless English™ system.
<br>What is the fuel? The fuel is your psychology. It is the beliefs, emotions, and
<br>goals that power your learning. Your fuel is your motivation, your confidence, your
<br>energy, your enthusiasm.
<br>Your Fuel: Success Psychology
<br>If your psychology is weak, even the best method will fail. In other words, if you
<br>have connected stress, fear, nervousness, and doubt to the process of speaking
<br>English you will have a lot of problems. Unfortunately, this is exactly what happens
<br>in most schools. The tests, the error corrections, and the boring and ineffective
<br>methods used in schools combine to create powerful negative emotions in most
<br>students.
<br>Even if you’re using my Effortless English™ method, you must have strong
<br>psychology. Unless you bring the proper emotional energy to the language-learning
<br>process, it won’t be enough.
<br>The Effortless English™ system is based upon a success psychology system
<br>known as Neuro-Linguistic Programming, or NLP. Developed by Richard Bandler
<br>and John Grinder, NLP is focused on the psychology of success, high-performance,
<br>and motivation. Rather than study mentally ill people, Bandler and Grinder
<br>esearched the psychology of the most successful people in the world. They then
<br>created a psychological system designed to help individuals achieve the highest
<br>levels of success and happiness in their lives.
<br>What Bandler and Grinder found was that happy, motivated and energetic people
<br>actually learn better. They perform better. They achieve more success in all aspects
<br>of their lives. The opposite is also true: If you’re feeling bored, stressed, sad,
<br>frustrated or even tired, your brain actually functions more slowly and has a harder
<br>time remembering information.
<br>Clearly, it is important to connect positive, rather than negative, emotions to the
<br>process of learning and speaking English. The process of connecting emotions to
<br>an experience or process is called anchoring. Anchoring can be positive or
<br>negative. For example, imagine that you listen to a specific song when you are
<br>feeling extremely happy. If the emotion is strong enough, a connection will be
<br>formed between the song and the emotion. And if you are feeling very happy when
<br>you hear the song again, that connection will become stronger.
<br>Eventually, you will create a very strong connection between the song and the
<br>feeling of happiness. At that point, anytime you hear the song you will automatically
<br>find yourself feeling happy. That’s what happens with your favorite songs and that’s
<br>great!
<br>However, this process also works with negative emotions. Imagine that you have
<br>a stressful experience in English class. Maybe the teacher corrects one of your
<br>errors when you are speaking and you feel embarrassed. Now imagine that you
<br>continue to have a series of negative emotional experiences in English classes. You
<br>frequently feel bored, nervous and stressed while learning and using English.
<br>Eventually, a strong connection forms between English and the negative
<br>emotions. This is a negative anchor. Once this is formed, whenever you try to use
<br>English you will automatically begin to feel more nervous and stressed. This is why
<br>many “advanced” English learners still have so much trouble when trying to speak.
<br>Sadly, most learners now have powerful negative anchors connected to their
<br>English speaking. The good news is that negative anchors can be broken and
<br>eprogrammed. This, in fact, is your first step towards speaking English powerfully.
<br>Instead of feeling nervous, imagine if you suddenly and automatically felt
<br>powerful every time you spoke English? What if you automatically felt more
<br>excited every time you learned English? This change alone would improve your
<br>speaking.
<br>Through the power of anchoring, you can indeed connect these powerful
<br>emotions to English. The secret to breaking a negative anchor and creating a new
<br>positive one is intensity. The more powerful an emotion is felt (while using
<br>English), the faster and deeper the connection.
<br>So, to create a strong positive anchor for English requires a few steps.
<br>First, you must create a very intense positive emotion. Most people believe that
<br>emotions are something that happen to them, but in fact, we create our emotions. It
<br>is possible to choose your emotions and to create them consciously.
<br>For example, if you wished to feel tired and sad right now, what would you do?
<br>Let’s start with your body. How would you use your body to create a tired and sad
<br>feeling? Would you pull your shoulders back, or hunch them forward? Would you
<br>look up or down? Would you smile or frown? In fact, by simply changing your
<br>body you would change your feelings.
<br>To make yourself feel even worse, you would think about sad and negative things.
<br>Perhaps you would think about a big problem you have, or about a big regret. And
<br>what about your voice? You could moan, cry, or whine, and that would make you
<br>feel even worse.
<br>After doing all of the above for a few minutes, you would genuinely begin to feel
<br>sadder and more tired. This is how you consciously can create a negative emotion.
<br>Of course, this process works for positive emotions too, and that is good news!
<br>How would you make yourself feel more excited right now? Again, start with the
<br>body. Pull your shoulders back and push your chest up and out. Bring your head up
<br>and look straight ahead. Put a big smile on your face and hold it.
<br>Next, change your thoughts. Think about something great in your life. Think
<br>about the biggest success you have ever had. Think about your future success
<br>speaking English powerfully. Smile bigger. First you are just pretending, but
<br>eventually you will feel stronger and happier. That’s because your emotions change
<br>when your body changes. It’s a simple technique.
<br>Of course, you can feel even better by using your body even more. Instead of just
<br>standing and smiling, raise your arms over your head. Then jump in the air like you
<br>are celebrating a big victory. And use your voice. Shout and cheer loudly as you
<br>jump and smile and think of wonderful things. Go crazy! This is called a “peak
<br>emotional state,” an intensely powerful positive emotion.
<br>The final step, of course, is to connect this great feeling to English. So, still
<br>feeling great, immediately start listening to an easy English audio. As you are
<br>listening, continue to smile and move your body in a strong, positive way.
<br>Each day, just before you begin learning English, you will create this peak
<br>emotion. As you repeat this process every day, these strong, positive feelings will
<br>become connected to English. Eventually, every time you hear or use English you
<br>will automatically feel energized, positive and excited. You have broken the old
<br>negative anchor and replaced it with a new positive one.
<br>And there is more good news. Research has shown that people who are excited
<br>and energized while learning actually learn more quickly. They remember more
<br>and they remember longer. They perform better. In fact, you will speak English
<br>better right now simply by being in a peak emotional state. Creating this positive
<br>anchor to English, therefore, is your first step to faster travel on the road to fluency.
<br>Why Happy Students Learn More
<br>Dr. Stephen Krashen, a linguist at the University of Southern California and one of
<br>the top researchers on second language learning, believes negative emotions act as
<br>a filter, reducing the amount of new language input you’re able to learn. As a result,
<br>students who feel bad, anxious or worried remember less vocabulary and don’t
<br>speak as well. Essentially, they learn more slowly.
<br>The best way to counter this, Krashen says, is by keeping students interested,
<br>educing stress in classrooms and boosting learners’ self-confidence.
<br>In one study, researchers found that when they compared the performance of
<br>students who were energized and enjoying themselves in class with the performance
<br>of students who were just being drilled in material, the energized students did better.
<br>The same was true when they tested these students again at three months and later at
<br>six months.
<br>I see the same thing in our Effortless English Club™ community. When you look
<br>at our most successful members, you’ll find a common factor. They are all
<br>extremely enthusiastic. They have a lot of energy. They’re very, very positive. They
<br>have very strong positive emotions. When you use peak emotions you can speak
<br>better – right now.
<br>Therefore, each and every time you study English, create a peak emotional state.
<br>Change your body and your mental focus in order to create excitement and positive
<br>energy. Build a strong anchor, a strong connection, between English and your most
<br>positive emotions. Heal your English trauma.
<br>CHAPTER 4
<br>Your Beliefs Determine
<br>Your English Success
<br>In the last chapter, you learned the importance of fuel, or psychology, for English
<br>speaking success. You also learned how to anchor (connect) strong positive
<br>emotions to English.
<br>In addition to peak emotions, there is another important element of psychology
<br>that you must master in order to speak English powerfully: belief. Beliefs are our
<br>most powerful “brain programs.” They guide our decisions, our feelings, and our
<br>thoughts. They tell us what is possible and what is not. They open us to success or
<br>limit us to failure.
<br>We can put beliefs into two general categories: limiting beliefs and empowering
<br>beliefs. A limiting belief is typically a negative “program” that limits your potential
<br>and performance. In other words, limiting beliefs limit your success.
<br>The hidden curriculum is the source of most negative beliefs about English. Over
<br>time, schools consistently program limiting beliefs into the minds of their students.
<br>After years in school, most students share some or all of these limiting beliefs:
<br>English is complicated and difficult.
<br>It takes many years to speak English well.
<br>English is stressful.
<br>Grammar study is the key to English speaking.
<br>I’m not good at English.
<br>There is one right answer. There is one right way to say it.
<br>Something is wrong with me because I still can’t speak English well.
<br>My test scores are low, therefore I can’t speak English well.
<br>The best way to learn English is to sit in a class, take notes, and read a textbook.
<br>Only a few special people can learn to speak English powerfully.
<br>English learning is boring and frustrating.
<br>The problem with these negative beliefs is that they lead to negative emotions
<br>(about English). The negative beliefs and emotions then lead to bad decisions, and
<br>the bad decisions lead to disappointing results.
<br>For example, someone who believes that English is stressful, complicated, and
<br>difficult is unlikely to be motivated to work hard every day. Rather, they will
<br>constantly be struggling to force themselves to learn English.
<br>Someone who feels only a few special people can master English will likely
<br>become frustrated very quickly. They will assume that something is wrong with
<br>them, that they are “not good at English.” Again, their progress will be slow.
<br>Finally, those who believe that classes, textbooks and grammar study are the key
<br>may spend years using these ineffective methods, driving their old slow car on the
<br>oad to fluency and never achieving success.
<br>This is why beliefs are so important. They are the central programs in our brain
<br>that create feelings, decisions and actions. Beliefs are what make the difference
<br>between ultimate success or a lifetime of frustration with English.
<br>Beliefs tell you what an experience means. Whenever you have an English
<br>language experience, your brain must decide the meaning of what happened. In
<br>other words, your brain generalizes the experience. Your brain decides what the
<br>event means to your life as a whole. And with each negative experience, the belief
<br>can grow stronger and stronger. Eventually you become completely certain about
<br>the belief.
<br>For example, maybe you were repeatedly corrected by an English teacher. After
<br>each of these embarrassing experiences, your brain had to decide the meaning of
<br>what happened. Based on these events, maybe you decided that you were bad at
<br>English. Maybe you decided that English was painful and stressful. Each negative
<br>experience made the belief stronger.
<br>The problem is that these beliefs then affected all of your English experiences that
<br>followed. So whenever you had another encounter with English, it was always with
<br>these negative limiting beliefs. Because of this, you automatically viewed every new
<br>experience with English more negatively. If your beliefs are strongly negative and
<br>you don’t change them, you can completely destroy your ability to succeed as an
<br>English speaker. Many English learners completely lose hope and simply quit, never
<br>to succeed.
<br>You must, therefore, replace your limiting beliefs with strong empowering ones.
<br>“Empowering” means “giving power.” So an empowering belief is one that gives
<br>you power!
<br>What kind of empowering beliefs do you need for English speaking success?
<br>Here is a sample list:
<br>English is easy, fun and exciting.
<br>I can speak English fluently in about six months.
<br>Mistakes are normal and necessary. Even native speakers make mistakes.
<br>Communication, not a test score, is the purpose of English speaking.
<br>Grammar study kills English speaking.
<br>Anyone can learn to speak English powerfully.
<br>There’s nothing wrong with me, I’ve just been using a bad method and I can
<br>change that.
<br>I’m sure you can see how much stronger these beliefs are. You can see that these
<br>beliefs are more likely to create success than the limiting ones. You can probably
<br>imagine the greater feelings of confidence and excitement that these beliefs create.
<br>But how do you create these beliefs? Clearly the empowering beliefs are more
<br>desirable, but how do you truly re-program your mind?
<br>One powerful method for changing beliefs is called modeling. Modeling simply
<br>means to find a successful person and study them carefully. If you want to speak
<br>English powerfully, for example, you find another person who has learned to do it.
<br>You learn about them. You learn what they did and how they did it. If possible, you
<br>talk to them and learn about their psychology and their methods. Finally, of course,
<br>you do your best to do exactly what they did.
<br>The more you model successful people, the more your beliefs will change
<br>automatically. By focusing on success instead of failure, you gradually re-program
<br>your brain. This is why I created the Effortless English Club™. In our community,
<br>the most successful members guide and advise newer members. While I hope this
<br>book will help to change your beliefs, there is nothing more powerful than hearing
<br>from another person, just like you, who achieved success.
<br>Your job now is to find successful English speakers and model them. You might
<br>find them in your town. You will certainly find them online. When you do find them,
<br>ask them about their beliefs and methods. Study their psychology and their success.
<br>This is exactly what I did when I developed the Effortless English™ system. I
<br>studied the most successful English learners. I interviewed them. I studied their
<br>emotions, their beliefs, their goals, and their learning methods. That is how I created
<br>a system based on success, not failure.
<br>Remember, beliefs are created by the meaning we attach to experiences. The more
<br>you focus on and think about negative experiences, the stronger the limiting beliefs
<br>become. You can make empowering beliefs stronger in the same way. In other
<br>words, you can use “selective memory” to create and strengthen your positive
<br>beliefs.
<br>How do you do this? Simply by reviewing all of your past experiences with
<br>English. As you remember all of your past experiences, search your memory for
<br>any that were positive. Maybe you remember a fun activity. Maybe you enjoyed
<br>eading a short story in English. When you remember these positive experiences,
<br>write them down. Create a list of all the positive experiences you have ever had with
<br>English.
<br>Most people can identify at least a few such experiences. The next step is to focus
<br>your attention on these memories every day. Each day, review your list of positive
<br>English memories. Remember each experience. See each one in your mind and feel
<br>those positive feelings again.
<br>Then write down a new empowering belief about English. You might write
<br>“English is easy and fun.” You might write “I enjoy learning English and I’m good
<br>at it.” Write this belief at the top of your list and also review it each day.
<br>And of course, every time you have a new positive experience with English, add it
<br>to your list. Your list will grow longer and longer. And as it grows, your
<br>empowering beliefs will get stronger and stronger.
<br>We all know the computer programming term “garbage in, garbage out.” Beliefs
<br>are our brain programs. Garbage (negative limiting) beliefs create negative
<br>emotions, bad decisions, and low motivation. These, in turn, create “garbage out” –
<br>terrible results. Those bad results then create new and stronger negative beliefs, and
<br>the whole cycle starts again, even worse. This is called a “downward spiral.”
<br>Positive beliefs, on the other hand, create an upward spiral. Empowering beliefs
<br>create more positive emotions, better decisions, and better motivation. These, in
<br>turn, create better results. Better results then create even stronger empowering
<br>beliefs. The whole cycle repeats again and again, getting stronger each time. This
<br>upward spiral is the key to rapid success with English.
<br>CHAPTER 5
<br>English Is A Physical Sport
<br>One of the greatest errors of the hidden curriculum is that schools teach English
<br>as an academic subject. In school you study English. You learn about English. You
<br>analyze the parts of the language (grammar, vocabulary, etc.). You take tests about
<br>this knowledge.
<br>The problem is, English is not a subject to be studied. English is a skill to be
<br>performed or “played.” Speaking is something you do, not something you analyze
<br>and think about. Perhaps you can see the problem.
<br>Real English conversations are very fast and they are unpredictable. The other
<br>person speaks quickly and you never know exactly what they will say. You must be
<br>able to listen, understand, and respond almost instantly. There simply is no time to
<br>think about grammar, translations, or anything else you learned in English class.
<br>English conversation is more like playing soccer (football). A soccer player must
<br>act and react almost instantly. The player must play the game intuitively. Soccer
<br>players do not study physics formulas in order to play well. They learn by doing.
<br>They “play” soccer, they don’t “study” it.
<br>Studying grammar rules to speak English is much like a soccer player studying
<br>physics to play soccer. It might be interesting (or not!), but it certainly won’t help
<br>performance. Your job, therefore, is to stop “studying” English and start “playing”
<br>it!
<br>Remember that your fuel is an important part, perhaps the most important part, of
<br>your Effortless English™ engine. Learning to play English, rather than study it, is a
<br>powerful way to develop strong psychology and go much faster on the road to
<br>fluency.
<br>When we first discussed fuel, we learned how to use our bodies to change our
<br>emotions. It turns out the body is, in fact, a very important (and neglected) key to
<br>learning English. By using physical actions while learning, it is possible to learn
<br>faster, remember more, remember longer and speak better.
<br>Dr. James Asher, a psychologist and professor emeritus at San José State
<br>University, found that using physical actions in language class actually helps
<br>students learn vocabulary better. Dr. Asher became curious about the link between
<br>language and movement after watching how young children learned to speak. He
<br>noticed that when parents said something, their children typically would respond
<br>with a word and some sort of action. He also noticed that parents frequently used
<br>actions and gestures while speaking to their babies.
<br>Based on his research and observations, Asher developed the Total Physical
<br>Response system of language teaching in which students respond to teacher
<br>commands in the new language with whole body actions. These actions strengthen
<br>the meaning of the phrase and make it easier to remember. Dr. Asher believes that
<br>students can learn 12 to 36 words in an hour using this method. I’ve had similar
<br>success using a version of it in my lessons and seminars.
<br>Of course, this is the complete opposite of what happens in most English classes.
<br>In school, you are told to sit still in your chair. You sit for an hour or more.
<br>Naturally, the longer you sit, the more your energy drops. As your energy drops,
<br>your concentration drops, too. And as your concentration drops, you learn less and
<br>forget more. Of course, this lower energy frequently leads to feelings of boredom.
<br>Less movement, less energy, lower concentration, and boredom naturally produce
<br>worse results, no matter what the method is, and so we have another downward
<br>spiral.
<br>While everyone benefits from physical learning, some people absolutely need it.
<br>These people are called “kinesthetic learners.” They learn best when they connect
<br>learning to physical movement. This kind of learner tends to struggle in traditional
<br>classrooms, where they are required to sit motionless for hours. Schools and
<br>teachers often label these people as being “learning disabled” or as having
<br>“attention deficit disorder.”
<br>The problem, however, is not that “kinesthetic learners” are disabled. Rather, the
<br>problem is a teaching disability — the failure of schools to teach active learners in
<br>an effective way.
<br>My Effortless English™ seminars and classes are quite different. Many have
<br>described them as “English rock concerts.” In an Effortless English™ seminar, we
<br>frequently jump, dance, shout, laugh, and move. In fact, it is rare for learners to sit
<br>for more than 15 minutes in one of my seminars. I want them moving. I want them
<br>energized. Because I know that active and energized people learn faster, learn more,
<br>emember longer and perform better!
<br>Remember, English is a performance skill, not a subject you study. The more you
<br>use your body while learning, the more success you will achieve. One way to use
<br>movement while learning English is to use the Action Vocabulary method. In this
<br>method, you connect a unique physical movement to a new vocabulary word. You
<br>shout the word (or phrase) and perform the movement. The movement should
<br>emind you of the meaning of the word.
<br>By doing this repeatedly, you connect the word, its meaning, and the unique
<br>physical action. This combination creates a stronger and deeper memory, resulting
<br>in faster and deeper vocabulary learning. This is far more effective than simply
<br>trying to memorize long lists of words.
<br>Another simple way to use your body is to walk while learning English. With a
<br>smart phone you can make your learning mobile! Instead of sitting on your butt,
<br>slowly losing energy, put on your headphones and go for a walk while listening to
<br>English. As you walk, your heart will pump and your brain will get more blood.
<br>You’ll feel more energy and thus you will concentrate better. You’ll probably enjoy
<br>learning more, too.
<br>There is no reason to be limited by the old school methods. You do not need to sit
<br>motionless in a chair while you learn. You do not need to remain silent. You do not
<br>need to be bored and tired. As an independent learner, you are free to learn in the
<br>way that is most effective and most enjoyable for you. You are the master of your
<br>own learning. Enjoy it!
<br>Remember the peak emotion exercise you learned? This is another excellent way
<br>to use your body while learning English. Take a short “energy break.” Play your
<br>favorite energetic music. Jump, shout, smile, cheer and dance for a couple of
<br>minutes. Fully energize your body and create peak emotions. Then continue
<br>learning English. Take these energy breaks every 20-30 minutes every time you
<br>learn English. I guarantee you will get better results.
<br>Watch children when they are playing. They are happy, energetic and active.
<br>Children learn best while playing. They bring an attitude of play to everything they
<br>do. Small children don’t need much effort or discipline. They are energized by
<br>curiosity. They learn actively. They learn by playing and play while learning.
<br>It is time for you to rediscover these natural qualities. As an adult, you still learn
<br>best in this way. You, too, benefit from being active and energized while learning.
<br>You, too, benefit from physical movement and an attitude of play. As you use the
<br>techniques and methods in this book, always do so with a fun and playful attitude!
<br>There are two major parts to the Effortless English™ system: the psychology and
<br>the method. You know that psychology is the fuel that makes the engine go. You
<br>must develop that fuel to create higher and higher energy for learning. You have
<br>learned how to use peak emotion anchoring, beliefs, and physical movement to
<br>create that fuel. You have learned the importance of an active, playful attitude.
<br>In the next chapter, you will learn another psychological technique for creating
<br>the most powerful fuel possible for English learning.
<br>(See below)
<br>ACTION VOCABULARY
<br>So many students waste time trying to memorize English vocabulary. They
<br>study long lists of words. They repeat the lists many times, trying to memorize
<br>the English words and their translated meanings. Unfortunately, research shows
<br>that 80% of vocabulary learned in this way is forgotten in less than a year. That’s
<br>a lot of wasted time and effort.
<br>There’s another problem with this vocabulary learning method — it’s boring,
<br>and it kills long-term motivation. As a student, you must be very careful— killing
<br>your motivation is the worst thing you can do. Learning English is a marathon,
<br>it’s a long run. It requires high levels of motivation that are sustained for many
<br>years.
<br>Using boring vocabulary learning methods, therefore, is doubly bad: it is
<br>inefficient and it weakens motivation.
<br>There is a better way, as participants in my breakthrough seminars have found
<br>out. It is possible to learn new vocabulary in a way that is far more powerful
<br>AND is a lot of fun. When you learn in this way, studies show that you can
<br>emember 80% one year later! That’s powerful.
<br>The key to deep, powerful, long term vocabulary learning is movement. When
<br>you combine strong physical movements with understandable new vocabulary,
<br>you create deep connections in your brain and body. These connections are long
<br>term. They last! The key is to use a movement that reminds you of the meaning of
<br>the vocabulary.
<br>For example, imagine you want to learn the phrase “to proclaim.” First you
<br>would find the meaning of the word, which is “to say or announce publicly, often
<br>in a loud way.” After you know the meaning, you create an action that reminds
<br>you of it. You might put your hands to your mouth and pretend you are yelling
<br>loudly (“to say publicly and loudly”). Finally, you would shout the phrase “to
<br>proclaim” as you did the gesture at the same time.
<br>The more loudly you shout and the more energetically you do the gesture, the
<br>stronger the connection you make in your brain. By simply shouting the phrase
<br>and doing the movement vigorously several times, you will create a stronger and
<br>deeper memory of the meaning.
<br>In a recent seminar I did in Vietnam, I taught a number of new words using this
<br>action vocabulary method. The students shouted the new words with me, while
<br>simultaneously using the strong actions I showed them. Each action was
<br>connected to the meaning of the new word or phrase. By the end of the lesson,
<br>they knew those words completely, never to forget them.
<br>But that’s not all. Since Effortless English™ is a deep learning system, I
<br>epeated those new words again — this time in a story lesson. Each time I used
<br>one of the new words in the story, I asked the students to use the same strong
<br>gesture we had practiced. Through the Mini-Story lesson, the students got even
<br>more repetition of the vocabulary, with emotion and strong actions.
<br>Finally, I gave the students homework: download the audio of the same Mini-
<br>Story lesson, and listen to that audio every day for one week. If students do this,
<br>they will learn these new vocabulary words very deeply, and will remember them
<br>forever. That is the power of the Effortless English™ system, and that is the
<br>power of using physical movement while learning!
<br>EIGHT SIMPLE STEPS TO CHANGING YOUR EMOTIONS
<br>1. Find some exciting, energetic music that you LOVE.
<br>2. Before you start listening to your English lesson, play the music.
<br>3. As this exciting music plays, raise your head. Look up. Change your body.
<br>Pull your shoulders back. Stand tall. Then smile… smile a big smile.
<br>Take deep breaths.
<br>4. Next, move your body. Dance with the music. Keep looking up. Keep smiling. Jump and dance. Lift your
<br>arms over your head as you jump and dance and smile. Feel the happiness and energy from the music.
<br>5. Stop and say loudly, “Yes!” Say it again, “Yes!” One more time, “Yes!”
<br>6. Now play your English lesson. As you listen, keep your shoulders back. Keep your eyes up. Keep smiling.
<br>In fact, stand up and keep moving. Walk and breathe deeply as you listen to the lesson.
<br>7. When you listen to my Mini-Story lessons, answer each question loudly. Don’t be shy. Shout your answer!
<br>Keep your head and eyes up. Keep a big smile on your face as you answer with a loud voice.
<br>8. If you begin to feel tired or bored at any time, pause the lesson. Play your favorite music again and repeat
<br>all of these steps. Add more energy to your body and your emotions. Then play the lesson again.
<br>By managing your emotions in this way, you will study longer, you will remember more, and you will learn 2-4
<br>times faster. You’ll also teach yourself to be strong and confident when you speak English.
<br>CHAPTER 6
<br>Use Big Real World Goals To
<br>Motivate Yourself For Success
<br>Why, exactly, are you learning English? Why do you want to speak English
<br>powerfully? Surprisingly, many people have only a vague idea. They know that
<br>English is the “international language” and they feel they should learn it. In school,
<br>they are told that English is important. Some people are focused on tests scores.
<br>They are studying English in order to get a high score on the TOEFL, TOEIC,
<br>IELTS or other exam.
<br>Where do these goals come from? Typically, they come from the school system.
<br>In other words, they are external goals that are promoted by other people. Students
<br>are told these goals are important and thus spend years focusing on test scores. The
<br>problem is that external goals (goals provided by outside people) feel like work.
<br>These goals feel like an obligation.
<br>These goals are weak and uninspiring, and that’s a problem because goals are our
<br>ain’s targeting system. Goals tell our brains what we want, when we want it, and
<br>why we want it. A powerful goal energizes, inspires and motivates us to do more
<br>and be more. A great goal can totally change your life. Weak goals, on the other
<br>hand, produce weak results.
<br>Another step in developing your Effortless English™ fuel is, therefore, to
<br>develop stronger goals. But what makes a strong goal? A strong goal is one that
<br>creates a positive obsession in your mind. A strong goal is emotional. A strong goal
<br>not only motivates you, it seems to pull you towards action and success.
<br>A great goal is like a positive addiction. The goal keeps you focused on what is
<br>important in your life. You can’t forget about it. In fact, with a truly powerful goal,
<br>you will find it difficult to stop thinking about it. This goal guides you and
<br>motivates you even through difficult times.
<br>To be powerful, a goal must be intensely emotional in a positive way. This is why
<br>test score goals are so weak. Who gets excited and inspired by tests? In fact, for
<br>most people, tests are negative experiences that produce feelings of nervousness,
<br>fear and stress. That’s not very energizing or inspiring. No wonder so many people
<br>feel bad about English.
<br>So how do you find and create truly powerful goals? Begin by asking yourself
<br>power questions. These are questions that help you find your deeper reason for
<br>speaking English. As you go deeper, you will find more inspiring goals. And the
<br>best power question of all is simply, “why?”
<br>Repeatedly asking why is an easy way to find your deeper purpose for English.
<br>For example, you might first ask yourself, “Why am I learning English?” Maybe
<br>your first answer is, “To get a high TOEFL score.” That’s a weak external goal. So
<br>you ask yourself again, “Why do I want a high TOEFL score?” Maybe you answer,
<br>“To get a better job.” Again you ask, “Why do I want a better job?” Now you are
<br>going deeper, finding your true purpose. Maybe you answer, “To make more
<br>money for my family.” And then you ask, “Why do I want to make more money for
<br>my family?” And you might answer, “Because I love them and want to provide an
<br>abundant and wonderful life for them.” You have found your big internal goal.
<br>Your big goal is not to get a high TOEFL score, your true goal is to create a
<br>wonderful life for your family. English is a tool to help you with that goal. Isn’t that
<br>more powerful and emotional? Doesn’t that excite and inspire you more? Doesn’t
<br>that create much more fuel for your engine?
<br>Of course, everyone is different. Maybe your big goal is to travel the world and
<br>live a life of adventure – and you know that English is the international language.
<br>Maybe you dream of being a rich and successful international businessperson, and
<br>English will help you achieve that dream. Maybe you dream of studying abroad at
<br>an American university. Maybe you want to make international friends from many
<br>countries around the world. Maybe you have more than one big goal for English.
<br>The point is that English is a tool for communication. Just knowing a lot of words
<br>and grammar is useless. You must use the language to unleash its power. So the key
<br>to finding your big goal is to figure out how you want to use English in the real
<br>world.
<br>With English, you must focus on your real world reasons for speaking the
<br>language.
<br>Goals must excite you. You should feel enthusiastic and energized just thinking
<br>about your goals.
<br>Even though I’m writing on this topic, I too have sometimes been guilty of having
<br>weak goals. For example, I recently did a series of seminars and presentations in
<br>Thailand. My initial goals were:
<br>To teach people about the Effortless English™ system.
<br>To connect with more people.
<br>Now these were certainly positive goals – but they had no power. They didn’t
<br>excite me. They didn’t create passion. So I thought more deeply. I asked myself,
<br>“Why do I want to teach people about the Effortless English™ system? Why do I
<br>want to connect with more people? What do I want to contribute? What do I want to
<br>accomplish?”
<br>Better goals instantly came to my mind, including:
<br>I want to inspire people and change their lives!
<br>I want to awaken people’s passion and love of learning.
<br>I want to awaken their imaginations!
<br>I want to heal their English trauma!
<br>I want to totally change the way people learn English.
<br>I want to help people achieve their dreams using English as a tool!
<br>I want to build an international family of super enthusiastic learners!
<br>I want to give people incredibly positive & powerful emotional experiences!
<br>I want to give them happiness, laughter, passion, and powerful confidence.
<br>I want to free people from doubt, from insecurity, from boredom, from
<br>hesitancy.
<br>I want to help them achieve their dreams!
<br>Now these were exciting goals! These goals immediately gave me energy and
<br>power. They made me want to jump out of bed and get to work! They made me want
<br>to do a fantastic job as a teacher. They inspired me to learn and grow better and
<br>better. They made me want to create an amazing demonstration – not just some
<br>boring lecture.
<br>Such is the power of big and meaningful goals. Why do you want to learn
<br>English? What is the most exciting outcome you can imagine speaking English will
<br>ing you? What truly inspires you about learning English? Think bigger. Dream
<br>bigger!
<br>Do yourself a favor: Choose big, audacious, powerful goals for learning English.
<br>Ignite your passion!
<br>CHAPTER 7
<br>Program Your Brain For English Success
<br>While teaching English at a university in Thailand, I had a student named Ploy. On
<br>the first day of class, Ploy sat in the back row. During that class, she did her best to
<br>hide from me. She hunched her shoulders and tried to disappear behind the student
<br>who sat in front of her. Ploy remained silent during the entire class.
<br>After class I asked her to stay a minute. I could see that something was wrong and
<br>wanted to find out how I could help her. I told her, “I noticed you were hiding during
<br>class, is everything okay?” She said, “I’m not good in English.” Ploy then described
<br>her longtime frustrations with English, including bad grades, bad test scores, and
<br>embarrassment. Because of this history, she was convinced that she had a flaw and
<br>was “bad at English.”
<br>After talking with Ploy, I thought about her problem and her beliefs. I realized
<br>that other students in the class probably had similar feelings. Before I taught them
<br>English, I knew I had to find a way to help them reprogram their beliefs. That week I
<br>esearched more psychology techniques and discovered the method of “mental
<br>movie programming.”
<br>The following week, I taught the technique to the class and continued to use it
<br>throughout the semester. In just a few weeks, I noticed a dramatic difference. Ploy
<br>grew more confident and outgoing. First, she sat in the front row instead of the back
<br>ow. Then, she began to participate in class. Her classmates likewise grew more
<br>confident week by week. This experience showed me the power of psychology and
<br>why it is so important to program yourself for success.
<br>This chapter is the final step to reprogramming your psychology for English
<br>success. You’ll learn exactly how to program the beliefs, goals and peak emotions
<br>you need to develop race-car fuel for your Effortless English™ engine.
<br>The problem for learners is not a lack of intelligence, nor a lack of will power.
<br>You are not “bad at English.” What most people lack is control over their mind and
<br>emotions. In fact, you have all the talent, intelligence and power you need to master
<br>spoken English at the highest possible level. You simply need to learn how to
<br>control your power and use it to change your emotions, beliefs, and actions in an
<br>instant, exactly as you want.
<br>Like many English learners, perhaps you too suffer from “English trauma.”
<br>Perhaps you hold limiting beliefs, and feel frustrated, nervous or stressful when
<br>trying to speak. You want to feel confident and powerful when speaking, and to do
<br>so, you must learn to control your internal movies.
<br>Your internal movies are the programs you use to create feelings, beliefs and
<br>goals. You create these movies with your five senses: sight, hearing, touch, taste and
<br>smell. Your memories and your dreams are recorded in your mind as a combination
<br>of these senses. These are the ingredients you use to write and direct your own
<br>internal movies. These movies then create your emotions, thoughts and actions.
<br>When you want to change the results you get with learning English, you want to
<br>change two things: how you feel when speaking English and how well you actually
<br>speak. In other words, you want to feel confident while speaking and you want to
<br>speak skillfully. This chapter is about how to change your internal movies so they
<br>program you for both powerful feelings and skillful performance while speaking.
<br>As you think about the movies you make in your mind, realize that there are two
<br>things you can choose: What is in your movies and how that movie is made. If you
<br>frequently think about memories of embarrassment with English, that will change
<br>the way you feel. How that memory is structured is also important. For example,
<br>perhaps you remember a time when you were corrected by a teacher in class, and
<br>that memory creates nervousness about English. That memory is a movie in your
<br>mind. Internally, you see the event happening, you hear the teacher correcting you,
<br>and you feel the embarrassment (sight, hearing and physical sensations are the most
<br>common and powerful ingredients used in internal movies).
<br>For most people, if you make that negative movie larger in your mind, the bad
<br>feelings will get stronger. Likewise, if you make the teacher ’s voice louder, the bad
<br>feelings are likely to get worse. And you could focus on the sensations or feelings
<br>of embarrassment and move them faster in your body, again making them stronger.
<br>By changing how the movie is played in your mind, you change its power.
<br>These movie qualities are called “sub-modalities.” They are the specific qualities
<br>of each sense used in your internal movies. Each of the senses has several submodalities
<br>that can be controlled and changed.
<br>Visually, for example, you can change the colors of a movie, or remove color
<br>completely to make it black and white. You can change the size of the images in
<br>your mind, making them larger or smaller. If you imagine the movie showing on a
<br>screen inside your mind, you can change the distance to the screen, bringing it
<br>closer or pushing it away. You can change the brightness of a movie. You control
<br>the movement of your internal movies and can make them fast, normal, or slow
<br>motion. You can change the “camera angle” of your movie, changing the view of
<br>any scene.
<br>Internal movies have soundtracks, and these too can be controlled and changed.
<br>You control the loudness of the sounds in your movie. You control the rhythm. You
<br>can change the tone and pitch, making sounds higher or lower.
<br>And you also control the feelings or physical sensations in your movies. You
<br>control the temperature (colder, hotter), the pressure (more, less), and the location
<br>of sensations. You also control the intensity of emotions and can make them vibrate
<br>faster or slower in your body.
<br>Essentially, you are the movie director of your own mind. The question is, will
<br>you control these movies and consciously direct them, or will you let them control
<br>you? A good director controls the images, camera angles, sounds, etc. in a movie to
<br>create exactly the thoughts and feelings he or she wants the audience to experience.
<br>As director of your own mind, you can do the same.
<br>You can, for example, change your memory recordings. Memories are simply
<br>internal movies you have created about an experience you had in the past. For most
<br>people, these movies were created without conscious choice. The good news is you
<br>can re-direct these movies in order to make them weaker or stronger, and change
<br>the effect they have on your life.
<br>Let’s do it now. Think of a very happy memory. It can be anything, any memory
<br>that makes you smile. Close your eyes, smile, and think of that memory now. As you
<br>emember, notice the image or movie in your mind. What do you see? Then notice
<br>what you hear: does your movie have sound? And what about the feelings: how do
<br>you feel in this movie? Where are the feelings in your body? Do you feel vibrations
<br>in your body, or feelings of tension or relaxation? Just notice the details of this
<br>happy internal movie.
<br>Now become the director of this memory. If you only see a still photograph,
<br>make it into a movie by adding movement. Then make the image bigger in your
<br>mind, bring it closer to you. As you make it bigger, notice how your feelings
<br>change. For most people, making the movie bigger increases the power of the
<br>emotions (negative or positive). With a happy memory, you can make it even
<br>happier by making the movie bigger!
<br>Of course, you can also change the sound and the feelings. Try making the sounds
<br>a bit louder, especially the pleasant sounds. When you notice the good feelings,
<br>locate where they are in your body and how they are moving. Feelings are physical
<br>and are usually experienced as a vibration or energy in the body. Make that happy
<br>vibration faster, and have it move through your body more. For most, this will also
<br>increase the feeling of happiness.
<br>Congratulations, you just directed your first internal movie. You learned how to
<br>increase feelings of happiness by becoming a better director. You can use this same
<br>skill with negative memories, thoughts and beliefs. Let’s try it.
<br>Remember a negative experience with English. Perhaps it’s a bad experience
<br>from school, or a time when you felt nervous, frustrated, bored or foolish trying to
<br>speak English. As you remember this bad experience, again notice the details of
<br>your internal movie. See the memory in your mind. Notice if this movie has sound,
<br>and notice how you feel in the movie.
<br>First, bring this negative movie screen closer to you, making it bigger. Make the
<br>sounds louder and vibrate the feelings faster. Most people will feel worse by doing
<br>this. That’s not what you want. So now do the opposite. Push the movie screen
<br>farther away, making the movie smaller. Then make the movie darker and harder to
<br>see in your mind. Imagine this movie screen has a button that controls volume. Grab
<br>that button and turn it down, making the sounds quieter. In fact, turn off the sound
<br>completely. Finally, take a deep breath and calm your feelings.
<br>By doing all of these things, you’ll notice that the negative feelings are much
<br>weaker, or gone completely. You have taken an unhappy memory and made it
<br>powerless by consciously directing your mind. Most people believe that memories
<br>are unchangeable, but you have just proven that you are, in fact, in control of your
<br>memories. The same is true of your thoughts.
<br>You have a choice. You can be the conscious director of your mind or you can let
<br>your brain run wild. Most people do the latter and they feel powerless. They are
<br>controlled by negative thoughts and memories and bad experiences. This is not
<br>necessary. You can choose to run your brain, directing it to produce the thoughts,
<br>feelings and actions you desire.
<br>You can make the negative powerless and you can also increase the strength of
<br>positive memories, thoughts, beliefs and goals. You can control your brain instead
<br>of being controlled by it. This process not only works for memories, it also works
<br>for goals you want to achieve in the future. Think of a big goal for English, one of
<br>those large and inspiring goals that will change your life.
<br>Close your eyes as you think of this goal. Now consciously make a movie for that
<br>goal. You are the director! See yourself speaking English powerfully to other
<br>people. Choose a situation that inspires you. As you look at this movie, notice the
<br>faces of the other people as they listen to you. See them smiling as they understand
<br>and enjoy your English! Grab that movie screen in your mind and bring it closer, so
<br>the movie is much bigger. Then make the colors more beautiful. Make the image a
<br>little brighter.
<br>As you continue watching this great movie, notice the soundtrack. Hear one of the
<br>listeners say, “Wow, your English is great! How did you learn to speak so well?”
<br>Turn up the sound so you can hear this loud and clear! Notice how you feel when
<br>you hear this compliment. You’ll feel the pride and happiness in your body
<br>somewhere. Where is it? Wherever it is, make that happy vibration faster and
<br>stronger and then move it around all of your body. Feels great!
<br>You have just created your English power movie, and you are the movie star. You
<br>are confident and skillful. You are happy. You are amazing, speaking English
<br>effortlessly! Feels great!
<br>With this directing power, you start to program your brain for the exact beliefs,
<br>emotions and outcomes that you want. You focus on this power movie every day,
<br>and each time you create the movie it becomes stronger. Anytime a negative movie
<br>arises in your mind, you use your directing skill to make it smaller and weaker. Day
<br>by day, by consciously mastering your mind, you completely change your life.
<br>Of course this requires daily practice. Those old movies were created over many
<br>years, so you need to consciously create your power movies every day. By doing
<br>so, step by step you will re-program yourself for English success.
<br>One particularly powerful way to reprogram your movies is by using a method
<br>called “the swish.” The swish is a classic technique of success psychology and NLP.
<br>A swish is a way to instantly and automatically change a negative internal movie
<br>into a power movie that makes you feel great. For example, if you frequently feel
<br>nervous when speaking English, you can program your mind to automatically
<br>change to feeling powerful and confident every time you speak.
<br>You must practice and train this “swish” technique daily, but once it is
<br>programmed deeply, you will not need to think about it. Whenever you need to
<br>speak English, you will effortlessly feel strong and confident.
<br>Here are the steps for using the swish technique:
<br>1. Identify the feeling or action you want to change. Maybe it’s a feeling of
<br>nervousness when speaking English. First, make a movie of that negative situation.
<br>See, hear and feel what’s happening in this negative movie.
<br>2. Next you will create a power movie that represents your goal, what you want to
<br>feel and do instead. You could, for example, use the power movie in the previous
<br>example… a movie of yourself speaking powerfully and feeling great.
<br>3. Use the “swish” to connect the two movies and create an automatic change
<br>from the negative to the power movie. Essentially, you are anchoring the power
<br>movie to the old negative situation.
<br>This is how you do the swish specifically:
<br>Close your eyes and start by making a big picture of the negative situation you
<br>want to change. See it clearly. Then imagine there is a small dark square in the
<br>corner of that picture. That small square is your power movie. So you have the big
<br>negative movie on the screen in front of you, and in the corner of that screen is a
<br>small square which contains the power movie.
<br>Next, say “Wooosh!” and imagine that the small square explodes and becomes a
<br>huge movie screen. As it explodes, it completely destroys the negative movie and
<br>eplaces it. Now you see your power movie in front of you. It is big, bright, and
<br>colorful. It has a great soundtrack and it feels great. Notice the movie and let those
<br>happy feelings grow stronger.
<br>Be sure to say the word “Woosh!” loudly and powerfully, with a lot of excitement.
<br>Remember peak emotion and use a strong body gesture, too, in order to increase the
<br>positive feelings. You are creating a connection, an anchor, between the word, the
<br>gesture, and the power movie.
<br>Next, open your eyes for a moment to reset. Then close your eyes and repeat the
<br>entire swish process. Each time, make the explosion happen faster. The power
<br>movie explodes and destroys that old image. Shout “Woosh!” loudly and make the
<br>peak emotions of your power movie even stronger.
<br>Then open your eyes for a moment, reset, close your eyes, and do it again. Keep
<br>epeating the process, again and again. Each day, practice doing this ten times or
<br>more. Do it daily. It may take thirty or more days to program an automatic response.
<br>Once programmed, you will notice an amazing result. When you are in an English
<br>speaking situation, you may feel a brief moment of nervousness. Then suddenly,
<br>you’ll feel better — more powerful, more relaxed and more confident. It will
<br>happen automatically and effortlessly. This is the result of the swish programming.
<br>Make this a daily habit. You can do this swish process every morning when you
<br>wake up and it will only take a few minutes. During these few minutes, you program
<br>your unconscious mind for success. You change the old negative movies. You
<br>develop more powerful beliefs and feelings about English. You take control and
<br>become a skilled director of your own mind.
<br>You now have all the tools you need to develop powerful success psychology.
<br>You know how to create peak emotions and connect them to English. You know the
<br>importance of beliefs and how to change them through modeling. You know how to
<br>use physical movement to create emotions and enhance memory. You know the
<br>motivational power of big goals and how to find your deeper reasons for learning
<br>English. And you know how to consciously direct your mind to success by using
<br>internal movies.
<br>On the road to English fluency, you need two things: powerful fuel and a
<br>powerful car: strong psychology and a great method. You now know how to create
<br>the premium fuel you need.
<br>In the next section, you will learn what to do with that fuel — the specific English
<br>learning methods you must use in order to speak English powerfully. It is time to
<br>learn the Effortless English™ engine.
<br>CHAPTER 8
<br>Babies Learn Best —
<br>The Effortless English™ Engine
<br>You have now learned the first part of the Effortless English™ system: the fuel or
<br>psychology. You know how to create high-quality emotional fuel to power your
<br>journey on the road to English fluency. Now it’s time to focus on the engine that
<br>will use that fuel. This is what I like to call the Ferrari of language learning – the
<br>Effortless English™ method.
<br>As I noted earlier, Effortless English™ is a system I developed over a period of
<br>several years of teaching and research. Through trial and error, I’ve been able to
<br>improve and adapt this method to suit the needs of learners all over the world. As
<br>long as you bring the proper psychology and emotional fuel to the method, I
<br>guarantee you’ll arrive quickly at English fluency.
<br>For purposes of clarity, I have broken the Effortless English™ method into seven
<br>steps. I refer to these steps as the “seven rules.” In this chapter, I’ll introduce these
<br>ules and briefly explain how they work. I’ll also describe how this section will be
<br>organized, so that you can get the maximum benefits from studying English each
<br>time you sit down.
<br>Each of the seven rules is a piece of “profound knowledge” that will completely
<br>change the results you get with English. Professor Edwards Deming described
<br>profound knowledge as a new idea, strategy or distinction that powerfully changes
<br>the quality of results. Profound knowledge is often a simple change that creates a
<br>big improvement.
<br>Each of the seven rules is simple, but when used each will produce large
<br>improvements in your English speaking. Used together with strong psychology, the
<br>seven rules speed your travel along the road to fluency.
<br>I should warn you that this method is completely different from the hidden
<br>curriculum you have used in the past. Remember, Effortless English™ doesn’t
<br>depend on traditional methods. Instead, it is designed to follow the natural order of
<br>language learning seen with small children.
<br>Babies Know Best
<br>In fact, babies and small children are the best English learners in the world! They
<br>easily learn to speak as a native speaker, with excellent grammar, vocabulary,
<br>fluency and pronunciation. Instead of studying textbooks, perhaps we should look at
<br>babies and how they learn English.
<br>When a baby first starts to learn English, or any language, it mostly just listens. In
<br>fact, for many months, the baby or child will only listen without any real speaking.
<br>This period of listening is called the “silent period” by linguists. During the silent
<br>period, the baby is learning to understand the language. Of course, when a baby is
<br>silently learning the parents do not get worried. They don’t teach the baby grammar.
<br>They don’t get angry if the baby doesn’t speak.
<br>What do the parents do? They simply talk to the baby using very simple English.
<br>They use actions while they talk. For example, they point to Mom and say, “mama,
<br>mama,” over and over again every day. Eventually the baby realizes that “mama” is
<br>the word for his or her mother.
<br>Eventually, the baby will begin to speak. Perhaps one day they finally say
<br>“mama.” What happens? Do the parents correct the baby’s pronunciation? Do they
<br>try to teach the baby grammar? Of course not. Rather, everyone goes crazy with
<br>happiness because the baby said one correct word (usually with bad pronunciation).
<br>Everyone is smiling and laughing. Speaking English is a very happy time for the
<br>baby!
<br>During the next few years, the baby will continue focusing on listening. Its speech
<br>will gradually become better. The baby will use more words. Its grammar will
<br>improve, even though it never studies grammar rules! The baby’s pronunciation
<br>will improve. And yet, for many years, its listening will still be better than its
<br>speaking. The baby will understand more than it can say.
<br>This is the natural way of learning English. As you can see, it is very different
<br>than the way you learned in school. In school you focused on reading textbooks
<br>from the beginning. Perhaps you were forced to speak very soon, even though you
<br>were not ready. You focused on studying grammar rules. When you made a mistake,
<br>the teacher corrected you.
<br>Unlike the baby, you did not improve quickly. You didn’t improve your grammar
<br>naturally and effortlessly. Your pronunciation never seemed to get much better. And
<br>your speaking always seemed too slow. For you, English probably was not a joyful
<br>experience. English was not a playful and natural experience that you loved.
<br>Clearly there is something wrong with the traditional way of teaching English in
<br>school. Clearly we need a better method, a method that closely follows the natural
<br>way that humans are designed to learn a language.
<br>The truth is, your brain is an incredible language-learning machine. When you
<br>have strong psychology and an effective method, you learn English quickly. Even
<br>better, when you follow a natural approach, you enjoy the process of learning
<br>because you are no longer fighting against nature and your own brain.
<br>You have learned Effortless English™ psychology. Now it is time to learn the
<br>engine, the method, of Effortless English™. Each of the seven rules is an important
<br>part of this method. Each rule is a new way to “play English.” As you learn and use
<br>the seven rules, be sure to maintain a playful attitude. Be flexible. Have fun. Enjoy
<br>this new process of learning.
<br>The seven rules are interconnected and work synergistically. “Synergistic” means
<br>the rules are more powerful when used together than they are individually. Each rule
<br>makes the other rules stronger. Together they form a powerful method for
<br>achieving fluency and skill with English.
<br>How to use this section
<br>The purpose of this section is to help you learn to speak English confidently and
<br>fluently. Now that I’ve explained the psychology of Effortless English™, my goal is
<br>to make the material in these pages as practical and useful as possible. In the next
<br>several chapters, I’ll be explaining each of the seven rules of Effortless English™ in
<br>detail. I’ll also be including more motivational tips, teaching examples and sample
<br>practice exercises to assist you on your road to fluency.
<br>As you learn each rule, you’ll get another piece of the Effortless English™
<br>method. Together they form a complete learning system. At the end of this section I
<br>will teach you how to put these rules together to create your own daily individual
<br>learning plan. You’ll learn exactly what to do, each day, to achieve spoken English
<br>mastery.
<br>Enjoy the ride.
<br>CHAPTER 9
<br>The First Rule – Learn Phrases Not Words
<br>If you’ve taken English classes, chances are you’ve had plenty of experience
<br>memorizing lists of vocabulary words.
<br>With Effortless English™ you are not going to do that anymore. Why? Because
<br>vocabulary lists are a waste of time. Yes, you heard me right. Trying to memorize a
<br>bunch of random individual words is not an effective way to learn. Instead, you’re
<br>going to use the first rule of the Effortless English™ method and learn phrases not
<br>words.
<br>What do I mean by “phrases?” Phrases are groups of words that are related, and
<br>focus on an idea. Another way to describe phrases is as “natural chunks of
<br>language.” In any language, certain words naturally go together in a certain way.
<br>For example, in English we say “I am on an island.” We don’t say, “I am at an
<br>island.” Why? There is no logical reason. One is simply a common and acceptable
<br>phrase and the other is not.
<br>Here’s another example. Let’s say that hate is one of the new words you want to
<br>learn. In a traditional class, you’d write down the word hate and then go look it up
<br>in the dictionary to find its meaning. You’d see that it means to have a strong and
<br>intense dislike for something; to loathe or detest. Then you’d memorize it – hate,
<br>hate, hate, hate, hate.
<br>That’s the old way – kind of the textbook way, right? In school, you probably
<br>used this strategy to remember a lot of individual words. You had those big
<br>vocabulary lists, and you tried to memorize all of them for the test. For verbs, you
<br>also tried to memorize conjugation charts.
<br>Even worse, you probably learned these words by memorizing translations in
<br>your own language. Because of this, you often find yourself translating in your head
<br>when trying to speak English. First you think of the word in your own language,
<br>then you try to remember the translation in English. This extra step slows both your
<br>speaking and your listening ability.
<br>Trust me. It’s much better if you learn a phrase – a group of words. It’s easy. You
<br>listen to someone speaking real English, and when you hear a new word, you write
<br>it down. Or when you read a story and you see a new word, you write it down. Only
<br>you don’t want to just write down that one word. You want to write down the whole
<br>phrase or sentence that it’s in.
<br>In other words, you learn the language in chunks. So, instead of just writing down
<br>the word hate, you would write down John hates ice cream. You would write down
<br>the whole phrase and its meaning.
<br>It’s easy to look up words in an English language dictionary, which most students own. Phrases can present
<br>more of a challenge, since they can’t always be translated literally. That’s why I recommend all my students get
<br>a good idiomatic dictionary, or dictionary of English idioms. Idioms are common phrases or sayings in a language.
<br>If you just search online for “dictionary of English idioms” you’ll find a ready selection of these books to choose
<br>from.
<br>Why do we do this? What’s the power of phrases? Well, for one thing, phrases
<br>give you a lot more information. They give you much more information than you
<br>would get from a single word. As a result, phrases are easier to remember, because
<br>they have deeper meaning. They present you with a kind of picture or story,
<br>especially when you get them from something you are listening to or reading. When
<br>you hear, John hates ice cream, you remember the whole little story. You remember
<br>who John is. You remember that he had ice cream, and then you remember he hated
<br>it. He didn’t like it, right? So you have all these extra pieces of information. This
<br>extra information puts the word in context. It helps you remember the meaning of
<br>the phrase as well as the meaning of that word! This might not seem like much, but
<br>in fact this is a huge improvement for memory. By learning phrases, you will learn
<br>more vocabulary, you’ll learn it faster and you’ll remember it longer.
<br>There’s also another bonus. When you learn phrases, you are not just learning the
<br>individual word, you’re learning grammar, too. You’re learning how to use that
<br>word correctly with other words. You don’t need to think about the grammar. You
<br>don’t need to know the rules or worry about word order or verb tenses. It’s
<br>automatic. You’ll use the word correctly in a phrase because that’s how you
<br>emembered it.
<br>In the Effortless English™ system, this is one way that you learn grammar
<br>intuitively and unconsciously, without thinking about grammar rules. Phrases teach
<br>you natural spoken English grammar. By learning phrases, you are automatically
<br>learning both grammar and vocabulary at the same time. Two for one!
<br>Learning the Natural Way
<br>This is actually how native speakers first learn English grammar. It’s how you
<br>learned your own language. When we’re children, we learn in phrases. We learn in
<br>groups of words. Give it to me. Walk across the street. He fell down. (Note: in some
<br>cases the phrases I’ll refer to could be full sentences, since they contain both a
<br>subject and a verb like the previous example: He fell down. In other cases, a phrase
<br>could be just a few words within a sentence. In this book I am using the word phrase
<br>to describe any natural word group).
<br>The point is: we learn groups of words, not just one word. Word by word is slow
<br>and it doesn’t help with grammar. But when you learn a whole phrase, you are
<br>getting extra information. Maybe you don’t know it, but you are.
<br>Let’s return to our example: John hates ice cream. Remember, our initial word
<br>was hate. But now you see there’s an “s” at the end – hates, right? John hates. You
<br>know from grammar study that you’re making the subject and verb agree, but you
<br>don’t need to think about that. You learn the grammar from just that word in the
<br>phrase, that “s” on the end, hates. And in the future, whenever you say John hates ice
<br>cream or he hates ice cream, you will automatically add the “s” because that’s how
<br>you learned it. You won’t have to spend time trying to remember the conjugations
<br>of the verb “hate” because you learned it correctly from a phrase and now it’s
<br>automatic.
<br>Of course, you don’t actually have to think about all of this consciously. Just by
<br>learning the phrase, you will automatically learn the correct verb conjugation. You
<br>eliminate the extra step of labeling and analyzing grammar terms. That’s why
<br>learning phrases leads to faster speech and faster understanding.
<br>On the other hand, if you learn all of this from a textbook, you’ll often just learn
<br>the root of the word “to hate” and you’ll focus on this form: hate, hate, hate. So you
<br>study it and you memorize it. That’s when you start making mistakes, because you
<br>memorized it mostly in this way, without other words. Later, you try to remember
<br>all of the conjugations of the verb. But because you didn’t learn this with other
<br>words, sometimes you might say “he hate ice cream.” You’ll forget the “s” because
<br>you never learned it correctly in a sentence, in a phrase. And in a real conversation
<br>there is no time to think about verb conjugations.
<br>Learning phrases will also help your pronunciation. One of the biggest problems
<br>I see with English learners is they speak with strange rhythm and intonation. Rhythm
<br>and intonation are the “music” of English. While many students worry about the
<br>pronunciation of individual sounds such as v, b, r, and l, their biggest problem is
<br>unnatural rhythm.
<br>The rhythm of English is created by the natural pattern of pauses. Native speakers
<br>naturally pause between phrases. They speak the language in phrases, in short
<br>chunks of English. Because they learned English mostly from phrases, their
<br>pronunciation is clear and easy to understand. On the other hand, many students
<br>learn English by memorizing individual words, and when they speak, they speak
<br>word by word, one at a time. As a result, they often pause in strange places. They
<br>create unnatural word groupings. This creates a very strange and unnatural rhythm
<br>that many native speakers struggle to understand. This is very frustrating for the
<br>speaker and for the listener.
<br>One of the easiest ways to improve speaking, therefore, is to learn phrases and to
<br>speak in phrases rather than word by word. This simple change will make your
<br>English speaking much clearer and much easier to understand. You’ll sound more
<br>natural. The words will flow out more easily. You’ll improve both pronunciation
<br>and fluency. You’ll even learn grammar.
<br>Where to Find Phrases
<br>So where does a student get these phrases? How do you know which ones to learn?
<br>The good news is that you can find them everywhere. Any natural English content
<br>contains a wealth of phrases. In a future chapter, I will tell you specifically where to
<br>get useful English phrases. But for now, focus on getting phrases from whatever
<br>English you are listening to or reading.
<br>To do this you need to start keeping a “phrase” notebook. Every time you see or
<br>hear a new word or phrase, write that phrase in your notebook. When you find new
<br>English vocabulary in a lesson, in something you are listening to, in a book, or in
<br>an article, write down the phrase. Not just one word, write down the entire phrase,
<br>and then review that phrase again and again each day. By doing this, you will create
<br>a notebook full of phrases and sentences you can use, not just individual words.
<br>You’ll be programming yourself to speak in phrases instead of word by word.
<br>If you’re watching a movie about a bank robbery, for example, you might hear a
<br>character say, “They’re getting away!” You know get means “to obtain” something,
<br>and you’re pretty sure away refers to “being at a distance” – like far away. But it’s
<br>confusing. So you write it down, “They are getting away.” Then when you look it up
<br>in an idiomatic dictionary, you learn that one meaning of “to get away” is to escape.
<br>You might also discover that sometimes when people are going on vacation, they
<br>say they are “getting away.” Even if you had previously memorized the words get
<br>and away on some vocabulary list, you still might not understand what the character
<br>in the movie is saying. But since you wrote down the phrase, you now know a new
<br>expression you can use in many different situations.
<br>Here’s another example. Let’s say someone describes their former pet by saying,
<br>“He was a bad dog.” It’s a fairly simple phrase, but you write it down in your
<br>notebook. Every time you review, you study that complete phrase. By doing that,
<br>you are getting free grammar – he was. You know this is something that was true in
<br>the past, not he is, which would mean the dog still was around. You’re also getting
<br>some free tips about word usage. We don’t usually say he was a horrendous dog, for
<br>example, even though the meaning is correct. In normal spoken English, we don’t
<br>usually use that word to describe a dog. This is not what you would learn from
<br>studying the definition of horrendous. You learn it by studying a phrase.
<br>When you write down a phrase, write where it came from. If you saw this in a
<br>newspaper article about the economy, put that down because that is going to trigger
<br>your memory. It will remind you of how the word was used and in what context.
<br>You’ll start to learn when certain phrases and words are used and when they are not.
<br>This way, you’ll begin to get a feeling about what is correct and how to put
<br>sentences together.
<br>IMPROVING YOUR PRONUNCIATION
<br>Pronunciation is a big worry for many English learners. Learning phrases will help, but there is another
<br>exercise you can do to improve even more. One of the greatest challenges with pronunciation is the problem of
<br>feeling strange when trying to use a native accent.
<br>For example, many learners feel unnatural when trying to use an American accent. They feel they are not
<br>being normal, or not being themselves. Their voice sounds strange to them. This is normal because speaking a
<br>different language naturally forces you to create different sounds.
<br>So how can you develop more natural English pronunciation? One strategy I suggest is to play a little game
<br>with movies. In this game you try to become your favorite English speaking actor or actress. This is a variation of
<br>the movie technique, which I will describe in more detail in a later chapter. When you speak, pretend you are that
<br>actor. Instead of worrying about your English, concentrate on speaking exactly the way the actor would.
<br>In fact, it’s important to think of this as a game and to even exaggerate the actor’s pronunciation, movements
<br>and facial expressions.
<br>Sometimes in my own classes I imitate the famous actor John Wayne, who played the hero in many old
<br>Westerns and was seen as the typical American. I’ll walk around my classes like I’m wearing cowboy boots and
<br>eady to go after some bad guys. Maybe you’ll feel more comfortable playing Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts or
<br>another movie star . . . the idea is to exaggerate their pronunciation and push yourself to speak just like them. Have
<br>fun, and you’ll be surprised how much this will help your pronunciation.
<br>The first rule of the Effortless English™ method is very simple. Yet this very
<br>small change to the way you learn vocabulary affects your grammar, your
<br>pronunciation and your memory of new words. Rule one is a piece of profound
<br>knowledge that works synergistically with the other rules.
<br>In the next chapter you’ll learn, perhaps, the most surprising rule of the Effortless
<br>English™ system. Rule Two frees you from the grammar translation method used
<br>in school and removes much of the boredom and pain of English learning.
<br>CHAPTER 10
<br>The Second Rule: Grammar Study Kills Your
<br>English Speaking
<br>The second rule of the method is the most shocking for most learners. After years
<br>of studying English in schools, most people believe that grammar study is the key to
<br>English speaking. In fact, many learners simply cannot imagine learning English
<br>without studying grammar rules. They have strong beliefs deeply programmed by
<br>the hidden curriculum.
<br>That is why the second rule is such a huge change. The second rule of the
<br>Effortless English™ method is: Do NOT study grammar! Now I know this might be
<br>a tough idea for you to accept. Let’s face it: for as long as you’ve been studying
<br>English, you have been told that you must learn grammar rules – in middle school,
<br>in high school, in university, in language schools, everywhere in the world it’s
<br>grammar, grammar, grammar, grammar.
<br>So my first question is: How did this strategy work for you? Was it successful? If
<br>you are reading this book, you’ve likely studied English for years and you focused
<br>a lot on grammar rules. But can you speak English easily, quickly and automatically
<br>ight now? Did all of this grammar study produce the result you want?
<br>If the answer is no, you are normal. Because despite what you learned in school,
<br>the truth is that grammar study actually hurts your English speaking. The problem
<br>with studying grammar is that instead of speaking English you focus on analyzing it.
<br>You become like the soccer player who is studying physics in order to improve.
<br>You learn a lot of information but your skill never seems to get much better.
<br>In other words, you think about English instead of doing it. You think about the
<br>past tense, the present tense, the future, the present perfect, the past perfect. Now for
<br>writing English, that’s not as bad. When you write English, you have time. You can
<br>think about things slowly and take your time. You can erase your mistakes. It’s less
<br>of a problem. You don’t need to write fast.
<br>But when it comes to speaking, there’s no time. You don’t have time to think
<br>about the rules for the present perfect tense in English when you are talking to
<br>people. If someone asks you a question, you have to answer it immediately. You
<br>don’t have time to think about prepositions. You don’t have time to think about verb
<br>tenses, possessives, phrasal verbs – all the other linguistic terms you’ve learned.
<br>There’s no time.
<br>A student of mine in Barcelona named Oscar once struggled with this very issue.
<br>He wanted to improve his conversational skills, however, all he could think of was
<br>grammar. Should I be using present perfect or another tense? That kind of thing. He
<br>said he felt like he was chained up and the words just wouldn’t come. So he stopped
<br>studying grammar. Over the next few months, his speaking dramatically improved.
<br>“It just started flowing out instead of me consciously thinking about it.”
<br>Research supports this, which is why linguists like Stephen Krashen recommend a
<br>more natural approach. Learning a language, Krashen notes, “doesn’t require
<br>extensive use of conscious grammatical rules and does not require tedious drill.”
<br>In a meta-analysis of grammar instruction, researchers found that studies over the
<br>last century have failed to find a significant effect for the teaching of grammar
<br>directly. The research is clear: Learning grammar rules does not improve your
<br>spoken grammar. You have seen this with your own speaking. How many times have
<br>you made a grammar mistake when speaking, even though you “knew” the correct
<br>ule?
<br>For example, many students who do well on grammar tests have terrible spoken
<br>grammar. They can tell you that the past tense version of “teach” is “taught.” Yet,
<br>when speaking, they will say “last year he teach me.” They know the rule
<br>intellectually, but this does not help their speaking.
<br>Another common problem is slow and hesitant speech. While speaking, a student
<br>will constantly be thinking of verb conjugations. All this analyzing slows their
<br>speech, making it painful and unnatural for the listener. Even when they manage to
<br>speak correctly, they kill natural communication by being so slow and hesitant.
<br>What Real English Sounds Like
<br>Real English conversation is tricky. Real conversation isn’t like what you learned in
<br>school. In fact, it often feels totally different.
<br>One key difference is the fact that real speech very rarely uses full or
<br>“grammatically correct” sentences. Of course, in school, those are the only kinds of
<br>sentences you learned. You learned about Subject-Verb-Object. You learned to avoid
<br>sentence fragments.
<br>Then you hear a real English conversation with real native speakers and you
<br>discover that they MOSTLY use sentence fragments!
<br>This is something I immediately noticed when I read the transcripts for some of
<br>our Effortless English™ lessons. I knew that most of us tend to use a lot of
<br>fragments in normal speech, but even I was surprised at just how often we do this.
<br>In fact, we constantly speak in partial sentences. We constantly use “run on”
<br>sentences. We constantly interrupt our own sentences and change our thoughts in the
<br>middle of speaking. A transcript of a real conversation – that is, a totally
<br>spontaneous and natural conversation – is completely different than anything you
<br>will find in a textbook.
<br>And that is only one difference – there are many other major differences between
<br>eal English conversations and textbook conversations or so-called “dialogues.”
<br>This helps to explain why even “advanced” English students have such trouble
<br>when they come to the United States. While these students may have good individual
<br>vocabulary (usually formal), they have absolutely no exposure to real spoken
<br>English. In school they learned how people “should” speak English – but what they
<br>eally needed to learn is how people actually DO speak English.
<br>THE TRUTH ABOUT GRAMMAR
<br>Sometimes people will ask me, “A.J., why are you against grammar?” I think
<br>it’s important to clarify that I most definitely am NOT against grammar. I just
<br>think people need to learn it intuitively. As a teacher, I need to teach it indirectly.
<br>What does “intuitive grammar” mean, exactly? Intuitive mastery of spoken
<br>grammar is based on a “feeling for correctness.” This is the method that native
<br>speakers use to learn and master English grammar. By avoiding grammar study,
<br>learning phrases, and using other natural methods, the native speaker learns to
<br>identify what “sounds right.”
<br>You do the same with your own language. As you speak, you do not think about
<br>verb tenses or other grammar. If you hear another person make a mistake, you
<br>know it’s a mistake because it “sounds wrong.”
<br>Intuitive grammar mastery is the only kind of grammar learning that works for
<br>fast English conversations. Your intuition is fast, your conscious analytical mind
<br>is not. You must learn to trust the natural process and let your grammar improve
<br>automatically.
<br>My students usually fall into two categories: those who are excited about rule
<br>two and those who are skeptical. I usually tell this second group to take a leap of
<br>faith. Be a scientist. You’ve spent many years trying to learn English the
<br>traditional way and look at the result.
<br>So try a little experiment. For the next six months, dedicate yourself completely
<br>to the Effortless English™ method. Use the psychology system. Use all of the
<br>seven rules. Give all of your effort for just six months.
<br>Then check the result. Did your English speaking improve? Compare the
<br>esults you got from six months of Effortless English™ to the results you got
<br>with the old school methods. If the Effortless English™ results are better, and for
<br>most people they are, then continue using Effortless English™. If you still feel
<br>that grammar translation is better for you, you can always return to the method.
<br>The Hidden Curriculum Can Be Hard to Break
<br>When I was teaching English in San Francisco, I had two Korean students named
<br>Jinny and Jacky (their American nicknames). Each of these students was struggling
<br>with her speaking and each wanted to attend an American university. In order to be
<br>accepted into a university, the students had to pass the new TOEFL test, which
<br>included listening and speaking sections.
<br>Jinny and Jacky had spent years studying English grammar in Korea. As a result,
<br>their speech was slow, unnatural, and hesitant. They felt nervous when speaking,
<br>constantly worried about making a mistake.
<br>As students in my class, I taught each of them Rule Two. I told them to stop
<br>studying grammar. I told them to get rid of their grammar books and their TOEFL
<br>books. I told them to do their best to stop even thinking about grammar.
<br>At first, both students were skeptical because this advice went against everything
<br>they had ever learned in school. Jinny eventually decided to accept my advice, while
<br>Jacky did not. Over the next several months, Jinny completely avoided grammar
<br>study. Jacky, unfortunately, continued. I would often see Jacky studying grammar
<br>and TOEFL books in a cafe after class.
<br>Gradually, Jinny began to feel more relaxed about English. Her speaking became
<br>more natural and fluent. She was thrilled with the improvement! Jacky did not
<br>improve. She came to me and again asked for advice. She had once again failed to
<br>achieve the required TOEFL score.
<br>Again I gave Jacky the same advice, stop studying grammar. Yet, despite her
<br>continued failure, she just couldn’t believe me. The beliefs of the hidden curriculum
<br>were so strong in her that she simply couldn’t accept another way. So she continued
<br>to focus on grammar books and TOEFL books.
<br>When I left that job, Jinny had moved on to an American university. Jacky,
<br>however, was still stuck in the language school. She was still studying grammar and
<br>still failing to achieve success.
<br>Jinny and Jacky’s story is powerful because it shows us how strong the hidden
<br>curriculum can be. Despite years of frustration and failure, some people just can’t
<br>seem to break free from grammar study. They will continue using the same failed
<br>method for years, never learning to speak English powerfully.
<br>To me, that is the worst tragedy of the hidden curriculum. These limiting beliefs
<br>imprison many people into a downward spiral of failure. It saddens me to see this
<br>cycle of frustration and stress.
<br>For some, it may be difficult to accept Rule Two, but this rule is essential for
<br>your speaking success. As Jinny and countless Effortless English™ members have
<br>proven, spoken grammar can be mastered without studying grammar rules.
<br>What I want you to remember is very simple: Do not study grammar rules. If you
<br>focus on grammar rules, it will hurt your speaking. You will speak more slowly.
<br>You will understand more slowly. To put it strongly, grammar kills your English
<br>speaking.
<br>So if you have grammar books, throw them away. Say goodbye to grammar
<br>books forever. If you want, you can even burn them, set them on fire. Have a little
<br>celebration. Because grammar translation is worse than useless, it is actually
<br>harmful to your speaking ability.
<br>For Practice
<br>Exercise: Take a grammar holiday. For the next six months, just decide you are not
<br>going to study grammar. In fact, do your best to completely forget about grammar
<br>ules. Unlearn this information by avoiding grammar books. Whenever you catch
<br>yourself thinking about grammar, immediately change your focus. During this time,
<br>instead of worrying about mistakes, accept them. Accept that mistakes are normal
<br>and necessary.
<br>Focus on communicating. The truth is that native speakers will still understand
<br>you even if you make grammar mistakes. While schools hate mistakes, normal
<br>people really don’t care. They simply want to hear your ideas, your feelings, your
<br>thoughts. In fact, native speakers make grammar mistakes, too, and they don’t get
<br>upset about them.
<br>CHAPTER 11
<br>The Third Rule: Learn With Your Ears,
<br>Not With Your Eyes
<br>My third rule for learning to speak English is simple, yet powerful. In fact, I
<br>usually say this is the most important rule because this is how we all learn language
<br>as children. It’s such an easy thing to do that you have to wonder why most English
<br>classes don’t emphasize it more.
<br>Here it is: Learn with your ears, not with your eyes. That’s right. If you want to
<br>speak excellent English, you have to listen. Listening, listening and more listening is
<br>the key to speaking excellent English. If you listen a lot, you are going to learn
<br>vocabulary. You will learn grammar. You will get faster at speaking and you will
<br>understand what people are saying to you. You will do all of this in a more natural
<br>and enjoyable manner. You will imitate the process that babies and small children
<br>use to learn a language.
<br>Academic research on language learning has consistently found listening to be
<br>the biggest factor in overall language ability – particularly in the early stages. In
<br>fact, this is true even if you don’t understand most of what you’re hearing. That’s
<br>because our ability to learn new words is directly related to how often we have
<br>heard combinations of the sounds that make up those words, says Dr. Paul
<br>Sulzberger, a researcher at Victoria University in New Zealand who conducted a
<br>2009 study on the subject. “‘Neural tissue required to learn and understand a new
<br>language will develop automatically from simple exposure to the language,” Dr.
<br>Sulzberger said. “This is how babies learn their first language.”
<br>Remember the process used by babies and children? Babies learn through
<br>listening. They don’t study grammar rules. They don’t use textbooks. They don’t
<br>take tests. Yet small children master spoken English, including grammar. In fact,
<br>experts say, 80 percent of your time studying English should be spent listening, even
<br>after you’re no longer a beginner. Unfortunately, most traditional language classes
<br>don’t emphasize listening. So if you studied English in school, you probably
<br>learned mostly with your eyes. I have observed many English classes in many
<br>different countries, and they’re all the same. Most English teachers – whether in
<br>middle school, high school, university or private school – focus on textbooks in the
<br>classroom. There may be short “communication exercises,” but the entire class is
<br>defined and driven by a textbook.
<br>Now, if your goal is to get a degree in English from a university, this is a great
<br>way to study. But if you want to speak real English, these kinds of traditional
<br>methods won’t get you there. Why? Because even if you study for many years,
<br>you’ve basically learned English analytically. You learned to think about English,
<br>talk about English and translate English. You also may know a lot about grammar
<br>ules. In fact, you know more about grammar rules than most Americans, most
<br>Canadians, most British people because native speakers don’t study that stuff very
<br>much.
<br>English conversation is different.
<br>Native speakers learned to speak English with their ears by listening, listening,
<br>listening, and that’s what you must do if you want to speak English quickly,
<br>automatically and naturally just like a native speaker.
<br>The most important factor for learning English is what Dr. Stephen Krashen calls
<br>“comprehensible input.” In other words, understandable input. Input refers to what is
<br>coming into your brain. You get English input in two ways: through listening and
<br>through reading. Certain kinds of reading are very useful and beneficial. However,
<br>the most powerful kind of input for learning to speak is listening.
<br>Comprehensible (understandable) input methods have been shown to be more
<br>effective than traditional methods (grammar study, drills, exercises, speaking
<br>practice). The research shows that speech happens as a result of listening.
<br>Think of babies and children again. Listening is always the first step. No child
<br>starts talking before they understand through listening. They always listen for a long
<br>time, until they understand a lot of the language. Then, and only then, do they begin
<br>to speak. This listening “silent period” is vitally important to the process of natural
<br>language learning.
<br>Another property of natural language learning is that speech emerges naturally
<br>from listening. Speech is not a skill that is consciously practiced or taught. Rather,
<br>after enough understandable listening, a child will just suddenly begin to speak. Its
<br>seems to happen by magic. The speaking ability grows out of the listening ability.
<br>Researcher James Crawford has found that speaking English is the result of
<br>listening and that English fluency frequently occurs from listening alone. He states
<br>that English learning is an unconscious process, and while it’s happening we are
<br>often not aware that it is happening.
<br>You can think of this like a seed in the ground. The seed, the potential for
<br>speaking, is always there. However, the seed needs water in order to grow and
<br>emerge from the ground. Likewise, our brains need a lot of understandable listening
<br>for effortless speech to emerge.
<br>As you might imagine, because children spend so much time listening before they
<br>speak, their listening ability is always higher than their speaking ability. In other
<br>words, children always understand more English than they can actually use in
<br>speech. As you use the Effortless English™ system you will experience the same
<br>thing. Your listening ability will naturally grow faster than your speaking ability.
<br>Some learners worry about this but it is the natural and correct process.
<br>Another way to think of this is that listening leads speaking and pulls it along.
<br>Listening is like a balloon with a string tied to speaking. As the listening level rises,
<br>it pulls the speaking ability up with it. They go up together, but the listening ability
<br>will always be higher.
<br>"BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND WRITTEN ENGLISH PERFECTLY."
<br>I hear this a lot from students who don’t understand why they have great
<br>comprehension of written English, but can’t speak it well. One reason is because
<br>English conversation is quite different from English reading. Conversation uses a
<br>different type of English, including different vocabulary.
<br>English conversational vocabulary is much more casual. In English, this means
<br>we use more words of Saxon or Old English origin during conversation. We also
<br>use more phrasal verbs (two- or three-word phrases with either a verb and an
<br>adverb or a verb and a proposition, such as get away, calm down or cheer someone
<br>up).T he difference between conversation and more formal English is one reason
<br>that even “advanced” students have difficulty with everyday conversations. The
<br>problem is that students learn more formal English in school. Formal English
<br>tends to use more words of French and Latin origin. This kind of English is, in
<br>fact, much easier for students who speak Romance languages such as Spanish,
<br>Italian, Portuguese, or French. These students often do quite well when reading
<br>English, but have a lot of trouble understanding normal speech.
<br>So, if you want to communicate with native speakers, it’s very important to
<br>learn from English conversation and audios – not just textbooks and reading.
<br>Learn English Conversation
<br>This is why listening is so important. Listening provides the foundation for
<br>speaking. As your listening ability improves, it will pull your speaking ability up,
<br>too. Too many learners are focused solely on speaking and they neglect listening.
<br>However, what use is speaking if you can’t understand the other person?
<br>Another reason listening is important is because the dynamics of spoken English
<br>are completely different from those of the written language. For starters, the
<br>grammar is different since we rarely speak in complete sentences. The vocabulary
<br>is also different with a lot more idioms and slang being used in speech. (See box.)
<br>And most importantly, the speed is different. Speech is fast. Super fast. So fast that
<br>you have no time to think about translations, or grammar rules, or textbook lessons
<br>or pronunciation. There is no time. Your conscious brain simply cannot analyze,
<br>translate, and organize real speech. This is the reason your speech is so slow. This is
<br>the reason you can’t understand two native speakers talking to each other.
<br>In fact, in order to perform at real speaking speeds, you must turn off your
<br>conscious brain and let your subconscious do its job. To do that, you must use
<br>methods which awaken your subconscious. You must learn holistically, intuitively,
<br>and naturally.
<br>Primarily, this means listening to lots of understandable English speech… and
<br>doing it repeatedly. As you listen, you quiet your conscious mind and just allow
<br>your brain to understand the whole meaning of the words. You don’t try to pick out
<br>individual words. You don’t worry about the few words you don’t understand. You
<br>elax and you let the meaning wash over you. Your mind is open and quiet. And
<br>then, when you speak, you just let the words come out. You don’t struggle. You
<br>don’t analyze. You don’t think about rules. You don’t worry about mistakes. You
<br>don’t think about translations. You just let the words pour out of your mouth
<br>effortlessly. This is what my students have learned to do. It takes time, but as you
<br>focus on listening and learning English effortlessly, your fluency, confidence and
<br>correctness will grow.
<br>Less Stress
<br>There’s another benefit to spending a lot of time listening to English – it reduces the
<br>anxiety people often feel when speaking a new language. Many English classes push
<br>new students to speak right away, but this is an unnatural approach.
<br>In fact, being required to speak too soon can slow down language learning. Your
<br>ain hasn’t had enough time to process the new words and store them in your
<br>memory. So while you may be able to repeat familiar phrases in English, you still
<br>won’t understand what people are saying to you. This is an unnatural and stressful
<br>situation.
<br>In one study of beginning-level English students, researchers found that those
<br>who weren’t forced to speak but were trained in listening comprehension did better
<br>than students taught using conventional methods. In addition, delaying speech also
<br>had a positive effect on students’ overall attitudes about English, and kept the
<br>classroom free of anxiety.
<br>Dr. J. Marvin Brown took this idea even further. The director of a Thai language
<br>program for foreigners, Dr. Brown created a program that mimics the silent period
<br>of babies and small children. In his AUA Thai program, students listen to
<br>understandable Thai every day but they do not speak for six months or more. The
<br>students focus completely on learning with their ears.
<br>For many foreigners, Thai is a difficult language to pronounce. Dr. Brown found
<br>that the silent period had a strong positive affect on learners’ pronunciation,
<br>eventually producing superior pronunciation much closer to that of a Thai native
<br>speaker.
<br>The same principle works with English. Though a silent period is not necessary
<br>for most intermediate learners, you still might try it. Why not focus completely on
<br>English listening for a few months, and then return to English speaking? You’ll
<br>likely find that your speaking has improved even though you never practiced it.
<br>What Should You Listen To?
<br>The most important thing to keep in mind is that you must listen to easy English. It
<br>has to be easy for you. That means you should understand 95% or more of what is
<br>being said. That’s without stopping the audio and without a dictionary. So it should
<br>be quite easy. I say this because the natural desire of most students is to pick
<br>something harder, thinking it will help them. It sounds more impressive to say I’m
<br>listening to CNN rather than a children’s program. If you choose something too
<br>difficult, you can get frustrated. With something easy, you get confidence.
<br>Remember Dr. Krashen’s idea of understandable input. If you don’t understand,
<br>you are not learning. No understanding means no improvement. Easier listening is
<br>almost always better than difficult. Eventually, you will be ready for more difficult
<br>material, but take your time and listen to plenty of easy English.
<br>If you’re just starting out, try listening to children’s programs since the English
<br>tends to be simpler. You can buy audio books online as a download, and get the
<br>audio book immediately so you can get started.
<br>If you find yourself listening to something more difficult, you can still use it, but
<br>you usually need the text. You can get an audio article or a speech, and use the text
<br>so you can read and listen at the same time. For more advanced learners, another
<br>great source of casual English conversation is film. Listen to American and English
<br>movies and read the subtitles. This will also help you. Just remember, listening is the
<br>most important thing. To get the most from films, use the movie technique below.
<br>If you don’t have an audio player or smart phone, get one. It will enable you to
<br>listen to English conveniently whenever you can. Listen in the morning when you
<br>get up. Listen when you go to work, or when you are at home. Listen when you are
<br>at lunch. Listen when you are coming home from work. Listen in the evening – lots
<br>and lots and lots of English listening, lots of easy listening. I even have a free
<br>Effortless English™ podcast on iTunes and you can listen to that. Listen, Listen,
<br>Listen.
<br>Rule Three is the reason that all of my courses are based on audio. Effortless
<br>English™ is a listening system where most learning is done through the ears. It’s
<br>okay to use text to help understanding, but focus most of your time and efforts on
<br>learning with audios.
<br>No matter how you choose to do it, it’s important to listen to English as much as
<br>you can. Some of my students have been reluctant at first. But most of them say that
<br>getting to choose what they listen to starts to make it enjoyable. Instead of suffering
<br>through yet another boring textbook drill, you can relax and listen to something that
<br>is interesting to you.
<br>MORE LISTENING PRACTICE
<br>Looking for another great way to practice listening to English? Perhaps you
<br>might want to follow my weekly Effortless English™ Show. I do a talk show
<br>about mastering spoken English. This show is a great way to get easy English
<br>listening. As most Effortless English™ members know, easy and relaxed English
<br>listening is an important key to speaking English fluently.
<br>To speak English fluently, you must listen to a lot of English – preferably easy
<br>and understandable English. My show is one way to get plenty of English
<br>audio. These are a great supplement to other English lessons or materials.

<br>Listening Practice
<br>To help students improve their listening, I often suggest an exercise known as the
<br>“Movie Technique.” To do this, you need to pick an English-language movie that
<br>you enjoy. Again, pick a fairly easy one, where you will understand most of the
<br>words used.
<br>Begin by watching the first scene. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes. Turn on
<br>the English subtitles. As you go through it, pause if there is a something you don’t
<br>understand. Look up the meaning of the word or phrase in an idiomatic dictionary.
<br>Watch the scene until you know all the words of it and understand.
<br>The next day, watch the same scene again, several times. Once you understand the
<br>vocabulary, turn off the subtitles. Then watch the scene again, listening without the
<br>subtitles. Do this every day for the next five days or so. You might spend four or
<br>five days on one scene, but that’s okay. Each repetition improves your English
<br>listening ability.
<br>Now watch the scene again, but try pausing after each sentence or phrase. Repeat
<br>the sentence out loud. In fact, don’t just repeat the sentence, act out the scene. Copy
<br>the speech of the actors. Copy their movements, facial expressions, and emotions.
<br>Pretend you are the characters in the scene. Remember the movie pronunciation
<br>exercise? This is another version of it.
<br>This entire movie technique might take you a whole week for just one scene.
<br>When you feel you have mastered the scene, you can start the entire process again
<br>with the next scene. It might take several months to get through one movie, to really
<br>learn it, but that’s the point. The movie technique is a way to thoroughly learn and
<br>master all of the English used in a film. This method will improve your listening,
<br>your fluency, and your pronunciation. If you just watch a movie once, without using
<br>this process, you get little to no benefit from it.
<br>WILL LISTENING TO MUSIC IMPROVE MY ENGLISH?
<br>I get this question a lot. Personally, I don’t suggest learning English through
<br>music. I get students coming to me with lyrics, and I can’t understand half the
<br>words the singer is saying. Music is an art form with lots of imagery in the
<br>language. Even native speakers often don’t know what the singer is trying to say.
<br>Likewise, the pronunciation used in songs is not normal. Singers frequently
<br>change the natural pronunciation in order to fit the words into the melody of the
<br>music. In terms of learning English, it’s much more efficient to use television or
<br>movies. The meaning of what people are saying is usually clearer, and you also
<br>have video to provide visual cues that help you understand. So yes, please listen to
<br>English language music if you like how it sounds, but don’t expect it to help your
<br>own communication in English.
<br>CHAPTER 12
<br>The Fourth Rule – Repetition Is The
<br>Key To Spoken Mastery
<br>You want to learn English and you want to speak it well RIGHT NOW. The
<br>problem is most language classes move too quickly for students to master material
<br>before moving onto something new. In this chapter, we’ll focus on the fourth rule of
<br>Effortless English™ which advises you to take your time and learn deeply.
<br>What does it mean to learn deeply? To learn deeply means to learn English to the
<br>point where speaking and understanding are automatic. Often people know a lot of
<br>English grammar and vocabulary, but they don’t know it deeply. When it comes
<br>time to speak, they’re translating vocabulary and analyzing tenses in their heads or
<br>struggling to understand the meaning of what someone is saying to them. Effortless
<br>English™ emphasizes training for mastery.
<br>Deep learning means repeating what you have learned, again and again. This
<br>might feel very different from the way you learned in school. Most schools have a
<br>lot of pressure to move fast. They’re always pushing the students to learn more
<br>grammar or a certain number of new words every week. The teachers rely
<br>primarily on textbooks, and try to finish them on schedule. The problem for
<br>students is that you learn a lot of stuff but then you forget it. Or you remember the
<br>basic idea, but you can’t use it.
<br>Take the past tense, for example. If you’ve studied English before, chances are
<br>you learned the past tense. Chances are also good that you studied it in a textbook
<br>and then *BOOM* very fast, you moved on. You went on to learn more grammar,
<br>possessives, the future tense or the present perfect tense.
<br>Now, if someone asks you if you know the past tense, you’d say, “of course.” But
<br>the truth is you haven’t mastered the past tense. You moved through the material so
<br>quickly that you never learned it deeply, like a native speaker. That’s why you still
<br>make mistakes with the past tense. Even though you may have studied English for
<br>many years, you still make mistakes because it’s not automatic. You haven’t learned
<br>it deeply.
<br>Master the Fundamentals
<br>To better understand deep learning, once again let’s look at the world of sports.
<br>Imagine, for example, a professional golfer. How does a professional golfer master
<br>the game and continue to improve?
<br>The most important skill for a golfer to master is their swing. A professional will
<br>practice their swing five hundred times a day or more, every day. A good golfer
<br>never says, “OK, I already know how to swing, so now I need to do something else.”
<br>Golfers understand that the best way to master the game is to master a few
<br>fundamental skills. They practice these same few skills hundreds of times a day, for
<br>years and years — possibly for their entire lives.
<br>Unfortunately, many English learners fail to understand the importance of deep
<br>learning. In my English classes, I frequently spent a long time repeating and
<br>eviewing the most common and most useful language. Sometimes a student would
<br>complain. They would say, for example, “I want to learn advanced grammar. I
<br>already know the past tense.”
<br>Yet, in a casual conversation, this same student frequently made mistakes with the
<br>past tense. He said “go” when he should have said “went.” He didn’t understand the
<br>difference between knowledge and skill.
<br>Remember, knowledge is something you analyze and think about. Skill is
<br>something you do. Knowing the past tense is useless. You must be able to use the
<br>past tense instantly and automatically in real conversations. You need English skill,
<br>not English knowledge.
<br>How To Learn Deeply
<br>If this sounds familiar, don’t despair. You can move much closer to your goal of
<br>speaking excellent English simply by adjusting the way you learn. You just need to
<br>slow down and repeat everything you learn again and again. For example, I tell
<br>members of my courses to repeat each lesson daily for at least seven days. This is
<br>the case even if they think they know it well after listening to it twice. If it’s still
<br>difficult, I advise them to listen to the lesson daily for two, three or even four weeks.
<br>Remember, it’s not a race. The point is not to memorize, or recite the phrases back
<br>like a bird, but to truly deeply understand the phrases you are learning.
<br>Often I get a question like this from a student: “A.J., can I learn two lessons in a
<br>week?” That’s a good question. People want to go faster. They want to do more. I
<br>understand that. But if you ask any of my advanced students, they will all give you
<br>the same answer: No.
<br>Why? Because deep learning is important. You need to repeat each audio every
<br>day for seven days. More is fine. Yes, 14 days is better, 30 days is even better than
<br>that. Less than seven won’t get the job done. You won’t be doing enough repetitions
<br>to have the material sink in deeply. It’s challenging to pace yourself, because I know
<br>many people think that faster is better. But it doesn’t work that way. You need to
<br>epeat each audio at least once a day for seven days. You’re doing this because you
<br>want your knowledge to go deeper and deeper. You are learning for mastery.
<br>Julia, a student from Italy, at first had a hard time accepting this idea. She thought
<br>she would get bored and that it might be a waste of time. But she wanted to improve
<br>her English, so she was willing to try it. Over time, she says, she realized she had
<br>spent years learning English but not in a deep way. “When I studied the second
<br>lesson,” she says, “I had already forgotten the first. “
<br>These days, Julia sometimes listens to an audio for an entire month before she
<br>moves on. “It’s not hard work anymore,” she says. “I’ve developed a way to listen
<br>and learn deeply and it has really helped my English.”
<br>So if you have an audio article or podcast, something you listen to and like, don’t
<br>just listen to it once. One time is not enough. Five times is not enough. You should
<br>listen to that article, speech, whatever it is 30 times. Or perhaps 50 times, 100 times
<br>or even more.
<br>After you’ve learned the vocabulary, keep listening. Because knowing the
<br>vocabulary means that you can take the test and say the meaning, but when you hear
<br>it do you instantly understand it? Can you use it quickly, easily and automatically? If
<br>the answer is no, you need to study it again, you need to listen to that same audio
<br>again. Many, many times. This is one of the secrets to speaking faster and to really
<br>learning grammar and using it correctly.
<br>You are like the professional golfer who practices his swing hundreds of times
<br>per day. The golfer is always looking for ways to improve that same fundamental
<br>skill. The golfer realizes that mastery of the fundamentals is more important than a
<br>lot of advanced knowledge.
<br>For example, you might listen to a story in the past tense over and over for two
<br>weeks. After that, you’ll listen to another story for two weeks, and maybe another
<br>story in the past tense for the same length of time. You never stop. I am a native
<br>speaker and all my life I have been learning the past tense. I still listen to the past
<br>tense now, and I will as long as I live. I’ve heard the same common vocabulary
<br>words every day thousands and thousands of times and will continue to hear them.
<br>That has enabled me to use them quickly and automatically.
<br>That’s the secret. You never stop. You just need more repetition. Focus on the
<br>most common words, most common verbs, most common phrases through
<br>listening and then repeat, repeat, repeat. When you do that, you develop that “feeling
<br>for correctness” and will use English more naturally and automatically.
<br>Perhaps you are thinking to yourself, “But won’t I get bored listening to the same
<br>thing again and again?” Of course this is possible. The best way to avoid boredom
<br>is to choose material that is compelling to you. Compelling means “extremely
<br>interesting.”
<br>How do you find compelling content? One way is to learn about something you
<br>love, in English. For example, if you love romance novels in your own language,
<br>get them in English! Find easy romance audiobooks and listen to them every day.
<br>Find the text versions of the books, too, and read while you listen. If you love
<br>business, then learn about business in English. Use English as a means of learning
<br>other knowledge and other skills. The more you focus on this compelling content,
<br>the easier it will be to repeat it often. You’ll enjoy hearing it again and again.
<br>Deep Learning Practice
<br>Exercise 1: Pick an audio that’s ten minutes long. This is going to be your main
<br>audio for the week. Listen to it a few times. Repeat this process every day for the
<br>next week. Really commit yourself to mastering it. The idea is you’re not trying to
<br>memorize it, but rather to thoroughly know it. Imagine that each time you listen to
<br>and understand the audio, it is going deeper into your brain. It’s like a seed you are
<br>planting in your mind. Plant it deep and water it with many repeated listenings.
<br>After you have mastered the first audio, pick two additional audios. They should
<br>each be 5-20 minutes long. Listen to these in the same way as you did the first.
<br>You will notice yourself going through different learning stages as you do this.
<br>Try to be conscious of these stages. The first will be, “Oh no, I don’t understand.”
<br>You may need to use a text for total understanding. You’ll know you’ve hit the
<br>second stage when you can listen to the words and phrases without reviewing any of
<br>them. The third stage will be when you’re hearing and easily understanding without
<br>the text. How long does it take you to get to the third stage? How does listening to
<br>longer audios affect your understanding?
<br>How quickly will you progress and how many repetitions are required? Much of
<br>this will depend on your state of mind during repetition. Are you relaxed?
<br>Energized? When I teach action vocabulary in seminars, students can often master
<br>new words and phrases in just a few minutes because they are moving and excited.
<br>Repetition with half-concentration and low energy is not as good as repetition with
<br>engaged emotional energy. So as you are repeating the audios, stand up, move
<br>around, and even shout the phrases to yourself. If you’re feeling self-conscious,
<br>close your door and do this in your room until you get more comfortable with it.
<br>Exercise 2: Select an audio for listening practice. A common complaint I hear
<br>from students about deep learning is that they get bored listening to the same thing
<br>day after day. So in this exercise, every few days you’re going to change your
<br>focus. On the first day, concentrate on just learning the vocabulary. On the next day,
<br>play a game where you’re just trying to understand the audio completely without the
<br>text. A day later, play a sentence, pause the tape and shout the sentence. Copy the
<br>speaker ’s rhythm, tone, and emotion. Work on your pronunciation. Next, try a game
<br>where you play two sentences and then repeat them loudly, with emotion. The next
<br>day, return to just listening and understanding. Basically, each day you shift your
<br>focus on the same material so that you learn from many different angles. The
<br>important thing is that each repetition you do has a purpose.
<br>CHAPTER 13
<br>The Fifth Rule: Learn Grammar
<br>Intuitively And Unconsciously
<br>I’ve promised that you can learn to speak English well, without studying
<br>grammar rules. I’ve even told you to throw your grammar books away because you
<br>don’t need them. Now I’m going to show you what to do instead.
<br>It’s actually a very simple technique – one that I believe is the best way to learn
<br>grammar – not only to learn English grammar, but grammar for any language. The
<br>fifth rule of Effortless English™ is: Use Point-of-View Stories. These are small,
<br>short stories in which we change the point of view. In other words, we change the
<br>time frame and we change the grammar to create multiple versions of the same
<br>story.
<br>By reading and listening to these story variations, you can learn grammar
<br>intuitively without thinking of tenses, conjugations, etc. Point-of-view stories are
<br>easy and fun. Best of all, they allow you to absorb the grammar naturally by
<br>understanding the context of stories. That is the key point. Rather than studying
<br>abstract grammar rules, you acquire spoken grammar skill from meaningful and
<br>memorable English.
<br>Point-of-view stories were first developed by Blaine Ray, the creator of the TPRS
<br>learning system. In the 1990s, Ray was a high school Spanish teacher in California
<br>who was looking for ways to engage his students beyond the traditional drill and
<br>memorization methods used in language classes. TPRS stands for Total Physical
<br>Response Storytelling (also described as Teaching Proficiency) through Reading
<br>and Storytelling (see box). It was Ray’s belief that students could learn to speak
<br>Spanish more naturally by listening to certain kinds of simple stories.
<br>I immediately recognized the power of these stories, and decided to modify them
<br>for my own teaching system. Point-of-view stories are now a very important part of
<br>the Effortless English™ system.
<br>How do point-of-view stories work? In the simplest version, you start by listening
<br>to a main story – usually told from the past point of view. In other words, the story
<br>is mostly about events that happened in the past.
<br>Next, you listen to another version of the story, with a different point of view. So,
<br>for example, you might hear the same story told again in the present. Then you
<br>listen to yet another version, told as if it will happen in the future. Or even another
<br>version that talks about past events that have continued to the present.
<br>Each point of view story is basically the same, but the change in time creates
<br>changes in the language used… especially the verbs. By listening repeatedly to these
<br>stories, you easily and naturally absorb the most common and most useful English
<br>grammar tenses. Because you learn them subconsciously and intuitively, you will
<br>actually USE them correctly when you speak – and you won’t have to think about it!
<br>An important focus of point-of-view stories is that they should focus on the most
<br>commonly used grammar structures. Some students become obsessed with
<br>extremely rare forms of grammar while neglecting the forms that native speakers
<br>constantly use on a daily basis. For example, “He slept for six hours” is far more
<br>commonly used than “He will have been sleeping for six hours.” It’s far more
<br>important to master the first form of the sentence (the simple past) as it is far more
<br>useful for communication. Thus, the point-of-view stories you use will be limited to
<br>only the most common forms.
<br>The great thing is, you only need to listen to these stories a few times every day.
<br>You don’t need to analyze the grammar changes… and you certainly don’t need to
<br>identify the linguistic grammar rules. There is no need to identify which version is
<br>the “simple past,” or which is the “past perfect.” These terms may be useful to
<br>linguists, but they are distracting to those who wish to speak quickly, easily and
<br>automatically.
<br>You must trust your intuition and simply listen to each version of the story
<br>without analyzing it. Try to quiet your analytic mind. Relax and focus on the events
<br>of the story. With time, you will absorb the grammar intuitively, and use it correctly
<br>without effort.
<br>PUTTING THE PHYSICAL INTO STORYTELLING
<br>Dr. James Asher, a psychologist at San José State University, was one of the
<br>earliest researchers to identify the importance of physical movement in learning.
<br>Asher developed the “total physical response” method (TPR) after discovering
<br>that students learned language more effectively if they associated words and
<br>phrases with meaningful movement. He taught language without translation,
<br>solely through the use of actions. For example, he would say to a class, “Sit
<br>down,” and then he would demonstrate the action of sitting. Then he would say,
<br>“Stand up,” and he would demonstrate standing. After repeating this series a few
<br>times, students quickly understood the meaning of the phrases “Sit down” and
<br>“Stand up.”
<br>In the next phase of the lesson, Asher indicated to the class to join him. So when
<br>he said “Stand up,” the whole class stood up together with him. And when he said
<br>“Sit down,” the class demonstrated their understanding by sitting.
<br>In the final phase, Asher gave the commands but did not demonstrate them.
<br>Rather, he watched to be sure the class understood. This eliminated the need for
<br>translation, as the students connected the phrases to the actions.
<br>With time, students in Dr. Asher ’s class were able to learn and demonstrate very
<br>complex commands such as, “Stand up, turn around five times, then walk
<br>backwards to the door and close it.” Dr. Asher built core fluency entirely through
<br>the use of commands and actions. Later, Dr. Asher and other researchers modified
<br>TPR, adding gestures to represent more abstract terms like “think” or “hope.”
<br>TPR was a predecessor of Blaine Ray’s TPRS (Total Physical Response
<br>Storytelling). Ray realized that if the actions and gestures were combined to create
<br>a story, students would learn even more quickly. TPRS is a method for getting
<br>students to physically and verbally interact as part of storytelling. This technique
<br>was the starting point for much of the Effortless English™ system.
<br>A Sample Point-Of-View Story
<br>Let me give you a very simple example of a point-of-view story: There is a boy. His
<br>name is Bill. Bill goes to the store. He buys a bottle of water. He pays two dollars for
<br>the water.
<br>Ok, that’s it. That’s our little story right now. It’s not very interesting, but you
<br>understand it easily. It’s in the present tense, and all you need to do is just understand
<br>it. If this was an audio story, you would listen to it every day for a week or more.
<br>Remember, we’re striving for deep learning, so you’re going to repeat it a lot of
<br>times.
<br>Next, I tell you the same story again, but now it’s in the past: There was a boy
<br>named Bill. Yesterday, he went to the store. He bought a bottle of water. He paid two
<br>dollars for the water.
<br>Ok, that’s all. Very simple. Of course, in my lessons my point-of-view stories are
<br>longer. They’re more difficult and they are more interesting. But this is a simple
<br>example to help you understand the concept.
<br>So now you’ve read or heard Bill’s story in the present and the past. Ideally, you
<br>have audio versions and you listen to that story in the past many times. When you
<br>listen, don’t think about the grammar rules. You don’t need to analyze, “Oh, this is
<br>the past tense” or “Oh, ’paid’ is an irregular verb.” No, no, no – no need to think
<br>about that. Just listen to each story version and understand the meaning. That’s all
<br>you need to do. Listen to the first story – understand the meaning. Listen to the
<br>second story – understand the meaning. That’s all. It’s easy, effortless grammar
<br>learning.
<br>After that, you would listen to the future version of the story: Imagine there will
<br>be a boy. His name will be Bill. He’ll go to the store, and buy a bottle of water. He’s
<br>going to pay two dollars for the water. That’s the end of our short example in the
<br>future.
<br>Again, all you do is just listen to this little easy story. You listen to the present
<br>version. You listen to the past version. You listen to the future version. Every day for
<br>seven days or more, you listen to each one.
<br>We can even add more versions. We can practice any kind of grammar with this.
<br>For example, I might say: There was boy. Since last year, he has gone to the store
<br>every day. He has bought a bottle of water every day. He has paid two dollars for the
<br>water. You don’t need to know the name of the grammar or the verb tense that I’m
<br>using. It’s called the present perfect, but you don’t need to know that. I don’t want
<br>you to think about that. All you need to do, again, is listen to this version of the
<br>story.
<br>Of course, I’m using extra phrases to help you understand the meaning. I said,
<br>“Since last year,” so now you understand that these verbs change because something
<br>happened in the past and it has continued for a while, but you don’t need to think
<br>about that. That’s why these stories are so easy and powerful. You just listen. You
<br>listen to story number one. You listen to story number two, and you listen to story
<br>number three and to story number four, and you learn the grammar like a native
<br>speaker. Like a child.
<br>When you learn grammar like this, using these kinds of stories, you are training
<br>like an athlete and you are freeing yourself from the hidden curriculum. This is the
<br>difference between learning grammar as abstract knowledge and acquiring the skill
<br>of using grammar in real speech. You want the skill. You want to use correct
<br>grammar without thinking about it.
<br>HOW TO LISTEN TO POINT-OF-VIEW STORIES
<br>To get the most out of a point-of-view story, do your best to focus on the story and imagine it in your mind as
<br>you’re listening to it. Turn off that part of your brain that labels the tenses or thinks about grammar. Instead, think
<br>of a line going through your body. Behind you is the past. In front of you is the future. Imagine now that the story
<br>you’re hearing is inside a box or radio. As you hear the past version, try to imagine that box sitting behind you,
<br>back in the past. When you listen to a future version, picture the box in front of you, up in the future. Imagining
<br>where you would put this box or radio on the line gives the story a visual component, which will help you to
<br>more intuitively understand the grammar.
<br>While it’s easy to understand this idea by reading sample point-of-view stories, it
<br>is essential that you use audio versions. Remember Rule Three: listening is the key
<br>to speaking. You not only want to learn grammar intuitively, you also want to learn
<br>spoken grammar. That means, just like vocabulary, you need to learn grammar with
<br>your ears.
<br>Learning grammar with audio point-of-view stories develops your “feeling for
<br>correctness,” the same skill used by native speakers. Each repetition and each
<br>variation develops this feeling. Eventually, you will instantly know correct grammar
<br>because it will sound right to you. No need to think about linguistic terms. That’s
<br>when you know the point-of-view stories are working.
<br>Remember that true grammar skill must happen instantly. In a real conversation,
<br>you must produce the correct grammar without hesitation. There is no time to think
<br>about rules. This instantaneous grammar skill can only be developed
<br>subconsciously and point-of-view stories are one of the best ways to do this. By
<br>using these stories, you skip the unnecessary step of thinking about abstract rules.
<br>You produce correct English grammar intuitively, without conscious thought. In this
<br>way, you use grammar like a native speaker. It takes time and repetition, but pointof-
<br>view stories give you the most effective training for spoken grammar mastery.
<br>The Psychological Benefits
<br>We have discussed the benefits of point-of-view stories to your English. These are
<br>significant. However, the psychological benefits of these stories are perhaps even
<br>more powerful.
<br>For most learners, abstract grammar study is one of the most painful aspects of
<br>studying English. Most people find grammar study to be boring, confusing and
<br>frustrating. Many dread the idea of trying to memorize yet another grammar rule.
<br>Most English learners have bad memories of grammar lessons and grammar tests.
<br>Grammar study has a way of making intelligent people feel stupid. They study
<br>and memorize countless conjugations. They analyze the use of English articles,
<br>prepositions, countable and uncountable nouns. Yet, when it’s time to actually speak,
<br>they find themselves constantly making mistakes. Even though they “know” the
<br>grammar, they struggle to use it. “What’s wrong with me?” they ask themselves. “I
<br>know this.”
<br>They are not stupid. They have simply confused knowledge with skill. Leave
<br>grammar knowledge to the professional linguists. Your job is to acquire grammar
<br>skill intuitively, and point-of-view stories are the best way to do that.
<br>Practice Exercise
<br>Here’s a fun way to create your own point-of-view stories. Find a simple story about
<br>something that interests you. The story might contain a few words or phrases that
<br>you don’t understand and have to look up in a dictionary. However, it should be
<br>easy. Five new words is the maximum that should appear in the story.
<br>Now, show this story to your English teacher, or an English-speaking friend. Ask
<br>them to rewrite the story from different points of view. They will write different
<br>versions for at least the past, the present and the future. After they write each
<br>version, ask them to read each one and record it. Then, for the next week or two,
<br>listen to all versions of the story every day.
<br>Once you have mastered those stories, repeat the process again with a completely
<br>new story. Simply by listening each day, you will develop your spoken grammar
<br>ability. Just like an athlete, you’ll train yourself in the skill of using correct
<br>grammar automatically.
<br>CHAPTER 14
<br>The Sixth Rule: Learn Real English
<br>And Trash Your Textbooks
<br>You’ve been studying English for years. But when you hear someone speak it
<br>doesn’t sound like the English you learned. You find it hard to understand, and when
<br>you speak, people look confused.
<br>Sadly, this experience is fairly common. It’s what happens when you’ve been
<br>taught English the traditional way where your teacher relies heavily on textbooks
<br>and classroom drills.
<br>That’s why we don’t use textbooks in Effortless English™. In fact, you have my
<br>permission to throw your textbooks away. Go ahead. Pitch them in the trash. As I’ve
<br>said before, textbooks aren’t the way to learn a language. With Effortless English™,
<br>you learn real English, and that is Rule Six.
<br>Textbooks have a number of problems. First, they are grammar-focused. We have
<br>already discussed the reasons you should avoid grammar study. Another huge
<br>problem is that textbooks mostly teach the formal form of English. This is the form
<br>of English you commonly find in writing. Textbooks rely heavily on written
<br>dialogues that are completely unnatural.
<br>Perhaps you recognize this one:
<br>“Hello”
<br>“Hello. How are you?”
<br>“I’m fine, and you?”
<br>The textbook may be accompanied by an audio, in which actors read this dialogue
<br>using strange rhythm and completely unnatural pronunciation.
<br>So what happens in real life? You study this textbook dialogue, and you think you
<br>know English. Then you travel to an English speaking country such as the United
<br>States. You meet a person at the bus stop and they say, “Hey, what’s up?” Of course,
<br>they are just greeting you and asking, “How are you?” but they are using the real
<br>casual English that is much more common among native speakers.
<br>In fact, as a teacher in San Francisco, I heard this common complaint most often
<br>from students. They traveled from many countries to study in America. Many new
<br>students thought of themselves as advanced English learners. Many had great test
<br>scores.
<br>However, when they tried to communicate with real people, they had tremendous
<br>problems. I remember one student named Humberto saying to me, “I can’t
<br>understand what anyone is saying. I don’t understand people at the bus stop. I don’t
<br>understand the waitresses in restaurants. I thought I was advanced, but I can’t
<br>understand anyone.” Like most students, Humberto had studied formal textbook
<br>English but had never learned real conversational English. He did well on tests but
<br>could not function in the real world.
<br>Real pronunciation is also much different than what you’ll find in textbooks and
<br>their audios. This is another source of difficulty for those who learn using
<br>traditional methods. Schools typically teach the formal dictionary pronunciation of
<br>English words. While the textbook will teach you “How are you?” a real American
<br>speaker is likely to say something like, “Howya doin’?” “Howzit goin’?” “Hey,
<br>whassup?” or “Nice-ta meetcha.”
<br>To really communicate in English, you absolutely must understand this real
<br>English. And these are only the simplest examples of greetings. The entire language
<br>is full of such examples. No wonder even “advanced” textbook English learners
<br>struggle to communicate with real people.
<br>Idioms are another common problem for textbook learners. Spoken American
<br>English is full of idioms, yet you’ll learn few of them from textbooks. Recently, I
<br>ecorded a conversation with my Dad on the topic of business. Later, as I reviewed
<br>the recording, I was shocked by just how many idioms we used in that short
<br>conversation.
<br>Idioms are phrases that have a meaning different from the individual words in it.
<br>They are often based on metaphors or cultural topics and can be quite hard to
<br>understand logically. For example, in a business meeting, a colleague might say,
<br>“We scored a touchdown on that project.” This idiom comes from the sport of
<br>American football, and it means to have a big success or victory. You’re unlikely to
<br>learn this phrase in a textbook, yet it is very commonly used by Americans.
<br>Clearly, textbooks are ineffective learning tools. What tools will you use then?
<br>You’ll learn the same way native speakers do: by using real authentic materials. Use
<br>only real English materials: the sixth rule. What do I mean by real? Well, I’m talking
<br>about English materials that are for native speakers or that are very similar to those
<br>used by native speakers. They can be books, articles, audio books, podcasts, videos,
<br>etc. You can find plenty of real English listening material on the Internet. Podcasts are
<br>perfect. I have a Podcast. You can go to
<br>https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/effortless-english-podcast/id188333691 and
<br>listen to me talking about English, talking about learning, talking about my ideas.
<br>It’s free. It’s easy. You can just listen, listen, and listen – there are a lot of real
<br>materials. I’m just talking normally and I’m a real native speaker. I’m not acting and
<br>I’m not reading.
<br>And there are a lot of other podcasts out there. You can pick English learning
<br>podcasts, or better yet, a podcast on any topic you like. If you like sports, find
<br>English podcasts that talk about sports. If you like cars, find ones that talk about
<br>cars. If you like exercise or health, find podcasts about that.
<br>Audio books are another great way to practice your listening. An audio book is
<br>just a book that someone’s reading and they record it. So instead of reading the
<br>book, you listen to the book. The key is to choose audiobooks that were created for
<br>native speakers. Also, choose audio books that are easy for you. You may need to
<br>start with children’s storybooks. That’s okay. I can guarantee that listening to a
<br>children’s storybook is more interesting and more useful than some boring
<br>textbook.
<br>One of my favorite examples of good authentic materials is a children’s book
<br>with an audio version. These are useful because you can listen and read along at the
<br>same time. You can also easily look up unknown vocabulary in a dictionary. I often
<br>have to tell my adult students not to be too proud to get a book for kids. You’ll
<br>probably find a book by Dr. Seuss is more interesting than a textbook, because it is a
<br>eal story written for native English speakers.
<br>As you get better, when your English level is higher, you can listen to audio
<br>books for young adults or for older children. Just keep listening to real English.
<br>When something gets too easy, choose something a little more difficult until that
<br>gets easy. Eventually, when you are advanced, you can listen to CNN or the BBC, or
<br>American movies, British movies, Australian movies, etc. But again, that’s at an
<br>advanced level. Start with easy stuff.
<br>By focusing on real English materials, you are immersing yourself in the
<br>language used by native speakers. You are not learning a strange special language
<br>taught only to students. By listening to real English, you guarantee that you are
<br>learning useful language that is used in the real world. At the same time, because the
<br>material you use is authentic, you also learn idioms and culture – which are vital to
<br>understanding spoken English.
<br>I have created an audiobook version of this book so you can use this book for
<br>English practice. See the back of the book for more details.
<br>Real English materials will even help you improve faster on exams such as the
<br>TOEFL. Research by Dr. Ashley Hastings found that students who learned with
<br>authentic materials (books, movies, TV shows) improved 35% more than students
<br>who studied in a TOEFL preparation course using sample tests.
<br>What about reading? While listening will be your main focus, reading authentic
<br>materials is also powerful. With reading, you follow the same principles as you did
<br>with authentic listening materials. You read easy English story books or easy
<br>English novels. You choose books that are pleasurable. Pick something you enjoy,
<br>something that’s interesting – maybe a romance or maybe an adventure story or any
<br>topic or category that fascinates you.
<br>Dr. Krashen calls this “free voluntary reading” and it is the most powerful way to
<br>increase your English vocabulary. Reading authentic materials has been shown to
<br>increase vocabulary much faster than studying lists of words. As you’ll see in a
<br>future chapter, this kind of reading is also the best possible activity you can do in
<br>order to improve your English writing ability. Research finds that reading and
<br>listening for pleasure leads to superior TOEFL performance. I always recommend
<br>my students start with children’s novels, usually something for elementary or
<br>middle school age. For beginners, graded readers can be useful. I also like series of
<br>books such as Goosebumps, The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew. These include a lot of
<br>books, more than 30 in some cases. They are easy reading and they will help your
<br>writing ability, reading speed, and vocabulary.
<br>As you improve, you’ll naturally seek out more difficult books and audios. One
<br>strategy is to find an author you like and read every one of his or her books. For
<br>example, if you enjoy scary stories you could read every book written by Stephen
<br>King. If you enjoy romance, why not read all of Danielle Steele’s books? If you can
<br>find audiobook versions for these, even better. By the time you finish an entire
<br>series of books, you will have improved your real English skills dramatically.
<br>In my Effortless English™ courses, I often focus on topics such as selfimprovement
<br>and success. I want members to focus on the topics and real English in
<br>my lessons, not on the parts of the language. The more you connect emotionally to a
<br>topic in the real world, the easier you will learn the English.
<br>In fact, the perfect situation is when you are so interested in the topic that you
<br>completely forget you are listening to or reading English. When this happens,
<br>language learning happens without any effort at all.
<br>TOO EASY? TOO DIFFICULT? OR JUST RIGHT?
<br>How should you decide what to listen to or read? Often, my students worry that
<br>they’ll pick something too easy. My recommendation: it’s best to pick something
<br>you can understand without too much difficulty, but that stretches you a little.
<br>Linguists call this “comprehensible input plus one” which they describe as
<br>material that is just one level above where you are currently. They believe students
<br>learn a second language best when they are in a low stress situation and are
<br>interested in the topic being discussed.
<br>An easy test of difficulty is whether or not you need a dictionary. You should be
<br>able to read and listen quickly, with only a few unknown words per page. Because
<br>you understand most of the material, you can guess the meaning of those unknown
<br>words without interrupting yourself. Just keep going, because you will eventually
<br>encounter those same new words again. When you do, you’ll make another, even
<br>better guess about the meaning. Eventually, you’ll learn this new vocabulary
<br>simply by enjoying real English without using a dictionary.
<br>When you listen to real English materials, you get the real English that is actually
<br>used by Americans, Canadians, Australians, the British, etc. That’s how we really
<br>speak. By replacing textbooks with these materials, you will be prepared for real
<br>world communication. When someone greets you on the street, you’ll understand
<br>them. When someone uses a common idiom, you’ll understand them. Eventually,
<br>you’ll completely understand TV shows and movies too.
<br>Rule Six is the key: learn real English.
<br>LEARNING CASUAL CONVERSATION
<br>In San Francisco where I used to live, I met many students with high English test scores, and great grades in
<br>their English classes. Yet, when they sat in a café, they couldn’t understand what people were saying around
<br>them. They had absolutely no idea what normal Americans were saying.
<br>They had been trained in formal, academic English – with a focus on grammar rules. I think this is totally
<br>backwards.
<br>Common, casual conversation should be the first thing you learn. The first need, after all, is to communicate
<br>with other people. You want to chat with people in a café. You want to make friends and understand what they are
<br>saying. You want to talk to your co-workers. You want to understand TV shows and movies.
<br>Common English should be what you learn first… then, and only if you need it, focus on academic English.
<br>To help you, we have a new collection of recorded, real, spontaneous conversations. These are real
<br>conversations with friends, family, and business partners. We aren’t reading scripts. We aren’t actors. You’ll learn
<br>the real English that we use every day with each other – including slang, idioms, swear words, jokes, cultural
<br>eferences, etc.
<br>You’ll hear filler words, too (such as “ah,” “um,” “you know,” “like”), which are a common element of
<br>English that is missing from textbooks. You’ll hear the natural rhythm of English – the way we go back and forth,
<br>the way we use phrases, the ways we interrupt each other.
<br>We have all the conversations transcribed, and include short notes to explain the slang, idioms, etc. that you
<br>can’t find in a dictionary. We did this because there’s a huge need. In fact, it’s probably the biggest need our
<br>members have.
<br>My friends and I created a course from these conversations, with text and explanations. You can find them at
<br>www.learnrealenglish.com
<br>CHAPTER 15
<br>The Seventh Rule:
<br>Learn English With Compelling Stories
<br>The primary purpose of Effortless English™ is to teach you to speak and
<br>understand English quickly, correctly and automatically. That “automatic” part is
<br>what separates this method from so many others, and automatic comes from
<br>thinking in English.
<br>When you think in English, you no longer translate. You no longer think about
<br>grammar or pronunciation. The language has become a deep part of you, just like
<br>your own native language.
<br>At this stage, you have achieved effortless English. You understand instantly, with
<br>no stress. Because you think in English, words flow out of your mouth quickly and
<br>easily. You use correct grammar, yet never consider grammar rules. If someone
<br>asks how you do it, you probably say, “I don’t know. I just know what sounds right.”
<br>Speed is the most obvious change at this stage. You are able to instantly
<br>understand and instantly respond. The hesitation is gone. The strain, the stress, the
<br>doubt, the confusion – all gone. You are like the professional soccer player,
<br>performing with power and grace.
<br>At this point on the road to fluency, you have learned most of the Effortless
<br>English™ system. You have just one more rule to learn and I have saved the best for
<br>last. Rule Seven is the method that trains speed. So what is it? Listen-and-answer
<br>stories. That’s the seventh and final rule of Effortless English™. Learn to think in
<br>English with listen-and-answer stories.
<br>What are listen-and-answer stories, or, as I sometimes call them, mini-stories?
<br>Well, remember in the past when you went to English school? You probably were
<br>taught with a lot of listen and repeat drills. You know, when the teacher would say,
<br>“Repeat after me. Hi, how are you?” And everyone in the class would say in unison,
<br>“Hi, how are you?” Then the teacher would continue, “I’m fine, and you?” Then all
<br>of the class together said, “I’m fine, and you?” This is listen and repeat. It’s an old
<br>way to learn English. But, it’s not powerful.
<br>Why? When you listen and repeat, you don’t need to think in English. You don’t
<br>need to think at all. You just repeat what the teacher said. You don’t even need to
<br>understand what you are saying, but still you repeat. It’s a mindless exercise with
<br>little benefit.
<br>Now sometimes, after you’ve gotten used to listening and repeating in one of
<br>these traditional classes, the teacher will start asking you questions so you can
<br>answer with some of the responses you’ve learned. For example, instead of having
<br>you repeat, she’ll ask: “How are you?” You’ll say, “I’m fine, and you?” This is a bit
<br>better, since you’re at least answering questions and not just repeating phrases you
<br>may or may not understand.
<br>The problem is, these are scripted answers. When the teacher asks, “How are
<br>you?” you always say, “I’m fine, and you?” You already know what the teacher is
<br>going to say and you already know what you are going to say. Yet, real
<br>conversations are unpredictable. You never know what is coming next. You have to
<br>be ready for anything. Listen-and-answer stories are much more powerful.
<br>Perhaps the first question we should ask is, “Why stories?” In Rule Five, I taught
<br>you about point-of-view stories. In Rule Six, I encouraged you to read and listen to
<br>authentic materials, especially stories. Now I’m telling you the key to automatic
<br>English is listen-and-answer stories.
<br>Stories are incredibly powerful, because they are an ideal way to deliver
<br>information to the brain. Human beings have used stories to teach and learn for
<br>thousands of years, since well before the invention of writing. What makes them
<br>powerful?
<br>Stories are emotional. We love the heroes and hate the villains, and that’s
<br>important because emotions create stronger memories. This is why religions have
<br>used stories for thousands of years to teach their principles. They could just teach
<br>the principles directly, but they know that stories create a stronger and deeper
<br>impression.
<br>And when a story is designed to be strange, funny, or highly emotional, it is even
<br>easier to remember. This is why listen-and-answer stories use strange characters
<br>and exaggerated events. Which is easier to remember: a normal person with brown
<br>hair, or a person who is only one meter tall with green hair? If you meet both
<br>iefly at a party, which are you most likely to remember a year later? Usually it’s
<br>the one that is not “normal.”
<br>In addition to being strange, funny, or exaggerated, listen-and-answer stories use
<br>a very specific technique called “asking a story.” Please note, I did not say telling a
<br>story. I said asking a story. This is a technique developed by Blaine Ray. The teacher
<br>creates the story by asking a lot of very simple and easy questions. Why?
<br>Because the questions train you to understand and respond more quickly. A listenand-
<br>answer story is not a passive activity. You must constantly understand a barrage
<br>of endless questions, and you must instantly respond to them. The teacher slowly
<br>builds the story by adding more details.
<br>An important aspect of these stories is that the questions are always easy and your
<br>answers are always short. Most of the time, you will answer with only a couple of
<br>words. The focus of these stories is speed, not length. Remember, to achieve the
<br>highest levels of English speaking, you must be fast. You must understand and
<br>espond instantly.
<br>As you listen, sometimes the teacher will ask a question and you won’t know the
<br>answer. When this happens, you are encouraged to immediately shout out a guess.
<br>So the process is a non-stop series of questions and answers. Through this
<br>process, you overwhelm your slow analytic brain. Because there are so many
<br>questions and you must answer so quickly, there simply isn’t time to think about
<br>grammar, vocabulary, or anything else. This is how listen-and-answer stories train
<br>you for speed.
<br>When you use these listen-and-answer stories, you teach yourself to understand
<br>quickly and to respond quickly. You have to speak quickly and automatically,
<br>without thinking, “What does that word mean?” That’s why these stories are so
<br>powerful. You learn to think in English, and you learn to speak quickly without
<br>translating.
<br>How Mini-Stories Work
<br>Let me give you a very easy and simple sample of a question-and-answer ministory,
<br>just a couple of sentences. Now, imagine you have a short little story about a
<br>monkey. In listen-and-answer stories, it would work this way. As a teacher, I would
<br>say: “Class, there was a monkey. Was there a monkey?” You would shout: “Yes!”
<br>You could also shout, “Yes, there was a monkey!” but a one word answer is
<br>sufficient.
<br>Then I would say, “Was there a monkey or was there a girl? You would
<br>immediately shout: “A monkey – a monkey.”
<br>And I would say, “Ah, so there was a monkey?” Again, you would shout, “Yes, a
<br>monkey.”
<br>I would say, “Ah, I see there was a monkey. What was his name?” Here you don’t
<br>know, so you guess quickly – John or Jim – anything – you would shout an answer
<br>as fast as possible.
<br>“Actually,” I would say, “his name was Reggie. Was Reggie a monkey or was
<br>Reggie a girl?” And you would shout again, “A monkey!”
<br>This continues for twenty minutes or more, slowly building the story. I continue
<br>to ask more questions, and because you are constantly answering questions, you
<br>learn to think in English. You learn to respond, to answer faster and faster in
<br>English. Now of course, this example is very simple. My real mini-story lessons are
<br>longer and much more interesting, and there are a lot more questions. (You can
<br>download a free sample Effortless English™ lesson, including a listen-and-answer
<br>story, at: http://EffortlessEnglishClub.com/point-of-view-grammar.) And when you
<br>use these lessons, you will gradually train yourself to think in English.
<br>Listen-and-answer stories are a form of active brain exercise. Because they are
<br>stories, you can visualize what’s happening. You learn the phrases, grammar and
<br>vocabulary in a meaningful context. Because the stories are strange and funny, you
<br>emember the English used in them much longer. Because you constantly answer
<br>questions, you learn to think and respond in English faster and faster.
<br>In fact, a good listen-and-answer story skillfully combines all elements of the
<br>Effortless English™ system into one powerful learning tool. I know of no better
<br>tool for rapid improvement in spoken English.
<br>HOW KNOWING THE CULTURE HELPS YOU SPEAK MORE FLUENTLY
<br>When I put together mini-stories, I try to make them funny or strange so that they’re easy to remember. I also
<br>try to reflect American culture, as youll see in the practice example at the end of this chapter.
<br>Why do I do this? Well, research has shown that you will learn a language more quickly if you can begin to
<br>identify with the culture. For example, according to Dr. Stephen Krashen and contrary to popular belief, even
<br>people who learn English as an adult can develop a perfect accent. What holds them back is not some inability to
<br>make new sounds, but rather their connection to their home country and its culture. When a child comes to the
<br>U.S. and learns English, they really want to fit in, so they will do everything they can to be like other Americans.
<br>Adults, on the other hand, have more established identities and tend to stay more rooted to their native culture.
<br>But there are ways to get around this. The best thing you can do if you’re trying to learn English is find some
<br>part of American culture that you really love (or British or Australian culture, if you’re studying English there),
<br>and can immerse yourself in. It can be anything – music, movies, food, martial arts, whatever – as long as you
<br>find it interesting. It’s especially useful if you can find something that is unique to the culture, like American
<br>football, for example. Most important, you must connect to and share your interest with native English speakers
<br>who love the same thing.
<br>Try it and see. This will not only help you speak more fluently, but it will also help your pronunciation as well.
<br>Movement and Mini-Stories
<br>I mentioned the importance of movement in earlier chapters. Dr. James Asher’s total
<br>physical response (TPR) system emphasizes the link between movement and
<br>learning. Blaine Ray’s TPRS method (Total Physical Response using Storytelling)
<br>links movement to stories. Effortless English™ uses both systems.
<br>When I do a live event, one of the first things I tell my students is that they need to
<br>make listening to a mini-story a whole body activity. Much of the power of (listenand-
<br>answer) mini-stories comes from how powerful your responses are.
<br>In any (listen-and-answer) mini story, you will hear only three types of sentences.
<br>You must respond to each type of sentence in a particular way. The first type of
<br>sentence is a statement. A statement is not a question, but you should still respond by
<br>saying “ahhhhhhhhh.” Remember, stronger movements and emotions are more
<br>powerful, so don’t just say “ahhhh,” shout it and move your body at the same time.
<br>Pretend the statement is the most interesting information you have ever heard! Nod
<br>your head and smile as you respond.
<br>The second type of sentence is a question you know the answer to. When you hear
<br>this kind of sentence, you want to shout an answer as loud as you can, using a full
<br>body gesture that shows you’re really excited about it. Exaggerate. Throw your
<br>arms up as you shout, “Yes!”
<br>The third and final type of sentence you will hear in a mini story is a question
<br>where you don’t know the answer. As I mentioned previously, in this case your job
<br>is to shout a guess as quickly as possible. As with the other sentence types, shout
<br>your guess loudly and use exaggerated gestures as you do so.
<br>The combination of speed, shouting, and movement locks in the memory of the
<br>sentence. Instead of just sound, you’re getting sound and movement and emotions.
<br>You’ll need fewer repetitions to remember it. You’ll also start to connect speaking
<br>English to that excited enthusiastic feeling because, at the same time, you are
<br>creating a positive anchor.
<br>There’s no stress with mini-stories because anyone can say yes or no. That’s why
<br>the questions are designed to be super easy. It is not a memory exercise, it’s a
<br>esponse exercise. You bypass the whole analysis part and go straight into fast
<br>esponses.
<br>Another exercise we do at live events is story retelling. Once students have
<br>listened to a story and they know it well, they retell it to a friend. They stand up and
<br>use their whole body with big, strong gestures and tell the story in a loud,
<br>enthusiastic voice. The idea is to tell the story as quickly as possible, focusing on
<br>speed, not accuracy.
<br>You will do this as well. After you have mastered the questions and answers, turn
<br>off the audio mini story. In a peak emotional state, retell the story out loud as fast as
<br>you can. Shout the story and use big gestures as you speak. Make it a game and aim
<br>for speed. It’s okay to make a mistake and it’s even okay to change the details of the
<br>story. Just practice speaking as fast as you possibly can.
<br>The point is that the best learning happens when you are in a peak state, involved
<br>and active. My live lessons are like “English rock concerts” and everyone has
<br>tremendous energy. To recreate this at home, put on your favorite music. Close the
<br>door so no one can see you. Now jump around just before you do the mini-story.
<br>Feeling energized, begin listening to the mini-story. As you’re doing the mini-story,
<br>get excited. Get crazy. Really shout out the answers. Finish with a fast retelling of the
<br>story. Remember, the more powerful your responses are and the more energy you
<br>use, the deeper your learning will go.
<br>Practice Exercise
<br>Here is a more advanced mini-story, without the questions. Note: the bolded words
<br>are the vocabulary I would teach my students in advance at a seminar. I’ve included
<br>part of the transcript to give you an idea.
<br>For a full audio version of this lesson, including the questions, go to:

<br>Listen and Answer Mini Story: The Race
<br>It’s five o’clock and Allen is riding his motorcycle in San Francisco. He is riding
<br>down Van Ness Street and comes to a stop light.
<br>A red Ferrari pulls up next to him. The driver ’s wearing dark sun glasses. He
<br>looks over at Allen.
<br>Allen looks at him and realizes that the driver is Tom!
<br>Tom sneers at Allen. He says, “When the light turns green, let’s race.”
<br>Allen says, “All right, you’re on!”
<br>Tom says, “I’m gonna smoke you!”
<br>Allen says, “You wish. I’m gonna beat you and your sorry-ass car.”
<br>Allen and Tom wait at the light. They rev their engines.
<br>Suddenly, the light turns green. Allen and Tom take off! They zoom down Van
<br>Ness at top speed.
<br>Tom is winning.
<br>But suddenly, blue and red lights appear behind Tom – it’s the police. They pull
<br>him over.
<br>Allen zooms past Tom, laughing. He yells, “Better luck next time!”
<br>Allen is the winner!
<br>Download the audio version of this story, including the questions. Listen and
<br>espond to the story every day for seven days or more (and remember, more is
<br>better because of deep learning). Each time you finish listening and responding, turn
<br>off the audio and retell the story as fast as possible. Notice as your speaking gets
<br>faster each day.
<br>CHAPTER 16
<br>Your Daily English Learning Plan
<br>So are you ready to speak English effortlessly? Are you ready to feel relaxed and
<br>confident every time you speak? Are you ready to let go of grammar study,
<br>textbooks, vocabulary lists, worksheets and drills? Are you ready to rediscover the
<br>joy of learning? Are you ready to focus on goals that inspire you? Are you ready to
<br>focus on communication with real people? Are you ready to “play English” instead
<br>of studying it?
<br>You now know the core Effortless English™ system. I have laid out a plan to help
<br>you learn to speak English naturally, fluently and with ease. Using the latest research
<br>and my own experience from more than two decades of teaching English language
<br>classes to thousands of students all over the world, I’ve shown why traditional
<br>language teaching methods don’t work. If you’ve been struggling with English for a
<br>while, I’ve also tried to give you hope. It’s not that you’re bad at English. Trust me.
<br>You just haven’t been taught the right way, the natural way.
<br>When you learn English naturally – the Effortless English™ way – you finally
<br>escape from the hidden curriculum. You don’t rely on textbooks or repetition drills.
<br>Instead you use the simple methods of the Effortless English™ system:
<br>Anchor positive peak emotions to English
<br>Change limiting beliefs into empowering beliefs
<br>Energize and move while learning
<br>Direct and control your internal movies
<br>Focus on learning phrases not words
<br>Don’t study grammar
<br>Learn with your ears, not your eyes; devoting 80 percent of your studying time
<br>to listening
<br>Learn deeply; be willing to put in the time and the numerous repetitions
<br>necessary to truly master spoken English
<br>Use point-of-view stories to master grammar
<br>Learn real English by focusing on authentic English materials that native
<br>speakers use
<br>Learn to think in English with listen-and-answer stories, which train you to
<br>espond automatically without translation
<br>The seven rules are the key to the Effortless English™ method. This method is
<br>the motor that will drive you to English fluency. But like any good engine, the
<br>Effortless English™ method is only as effective as the fuel you put into it. The fuel
<br>you need to learn English, or anything, really, is the emotional energy and
<br>motivation you bring to your studies. That’s why I’ve focused so much on the
<br>psychological aspects of learning. I’ve shown you how to generate the necessary
<br>emotional fuel for learning English by setting big goals. I’ve discussed how moving
<br>and using your body can help you learn more quickly. I’ve also demonstrated ways
<br>to channel your fears into the energy necessary to speak powerful and relaxed
<br>English.
<br>All you need to do now is get out there and do the work. After all, it’s not enough
<br>to just know these steps, you have to take action. “Work”, however, is the wrong
<br>word to use because the Effortless English™ system is most effective when
<br>combined with a playful mindset. You no longer need to fear mistakes. You no
<br>longer need to find the “one right answer.” You no longer need to stress over exams
<br>or grades.
<br>In fact, you will no longer “study English,” you will “play English.” You will
<br>enjoy your natural curiosity. You’ll use fun, interesting, compelling, real materials.
<br>You’ll feel energized and excited. You’ll move your body. You’ll smile and laugh
<br>while learning.
<br>Fortunately, there’s never been a better time to learn English. There have never
<br>been more resources available. Thanks to the Internet, there are few things you can’t
<br>access online – whether it’s a website on English learning, or articles, books, audio
<br>and video that can all be used to practice. You can even hire a teacher or get a
<br>language partner to work with you online.
<br>You are no longer dependent on schools. You don’t need to follow the hidden
<br>curriculum any longer. You are now the master of your own education. English
<br>mastery is within your reach.
<br>A Day in the Life of Effortless English™
<br>I’ve done my best to explain the Effortless English™ system. At this point, maybe
<br>you’ve decided you like the sound of learning English the natural way. You want to
<br>speak English effortlessly. The question is: How do you get started? How can you
<br>take all of what I’ve told you and put it into a typical day of learning English? What
<br>would that day look like?
<br>It is vitally important that you establish daily English learning rituals. What is a
<br>itual? A ritual is a habit that is emotional, even sacred, for you. Your progress
<br>depends on consistency. By continually making tiny improvements each week, you
<br>will accelerate on the road to fluency. Each improvement builds on the ones that
<br>came before, creating momentum.
<br>Week by week, your listening improves. For a while, nothing seems to happen
<br>with your speaking. You understand more but speaking seems to be no different.
<br>Then, suddenly, after a few months, something amazing happens. English phrases
<br>begin to come out more quickly and easily. It happens a little at first, then more and
<br>more each week. By the time you reach six months, you notice significant
<br>improvement in your speaking.
<br>This improvement is built through consistent daily rituals. When I teach seminars,
<br>I encourage students to create Effortless English™ rituals for the morning, the day,
<br>and the evening. For example:
<br>In the morning, immediately upon waking, play your favorite energizing music.
<br>As you listen to this music, take out your list of positive English experiences and
<br>empowering beliefs. Read each item on the list, and remember the emotion of the
<br>positive experience. Next, think about your biggest goals for English – how you
<br>will use the language to create a better life for yourself and your family. Finally, use
<br>the “swish” technique ten or more times to direct and program your power movies.
<br>At this point you are feeling great, so you’ve worked yourself into a peak
<br>emotional state. With the music still playing, jump, smile and shout until you feel
<br>fantastic! Now you are ready to listen to English. Play an easy English audio.
<br>Ideally, you will play a listen-and-answer mini story, followed by several point-ofview
<br>stories. As you listen, shout your answers to the questions and use big
<br>movements and gestures. If, at any point, you notice your energy dropping, play the
<br>music again and create a peak emotional state. Then start listening to English again.
<br>This whole morning ritual might take only thirty minutes. You start your day
<br>feeling great, improving your English. At that point, it’s probably time to go to
<br>work, or school. Use your travel time to listen to more English. Since you’ll
<br>probably be around other people, this is a good time to listen quietly to an
<br>audiobook.
<br>At lunch you’ll have more free time, so spend another thirty minutes or more
<br>listening to a mini-story or point-of-view story. If you have privacy, shout your
<br>answers just as you did at home.
<br>Travel home is another opportunity for more easy English listening. Perhaps you
<br>epeat that same audiobook chapter from the morning. If you stay at home with your
<br>kids, find moments of listening time when your kids are playing or napping. If you
<br>walk somewhere, or stand in line, listen to English. Use every available free
<br>moment to listen.
<br>When you are home in the evening, do more English listening. Ideally, choose the
<br>same time every night and once again listen to the same mini story and point-ofview
<br>stories in a peak state. This might take you another thirty minutes. Go into your
<br>oom if necessary to shout out the answers and really put your full energy and
<br>emotion into it.
<br>Then you might use the movie technique, studying and practicing a movie scene.
<br>And even when you are doing other tasks, such as cooking dinner, always have an
<br>English audio playing in the background. Surround yourself with the sounds of
<br>English all day long.
<br>By building these daily habits, and dividing your study time into four or more
<br>chunks throughout the day, you create intensity. The next day, you repeat the same
<br>ituals. Because you want to learn deeply, you repeat the same audios again. Listen
<br>to the same mini-story and point-of-view stories. Listen to the same audiobook.
<br>Watch the same movie scene. Do this for seven days or more to really master each
<br>of those audios. Next week, start over.
<br>The great thing about audio story lessons is that they can be done anywhere. You
<br>can read and listen at the same time. Or you can take a walk and listen, which is even
<br>better. Do whatever works for you. Just do it, and soon you’ll be speaking English
<br>fluently and with ease.
<br>For best results, dedicate yourself to an intense schedule for six months. During
<br>that time, listen to English every free moment you have, however short. Always
<br>carry English audios on your phone or audio player. Always have it with you. Use
<br>private time for mini stories, point-of-view stories, and the movie technique. When
<br>in public, listen quietly to audiobooks or other English audios. Fill every moment of
<br>your life with English.
<br>This consistent habit is the secret to your success. By focusing intensely for six
<br>months, you will make dramatic improvements in your English speaking ability.
<br>You will develop confidence and power. No, you will not speak perfectly, but no one
<br>is perfect, not even native speakers.
<br>You have used the old methods for years and are not happy with the results. Give
<br>Effortless English™ at least six months. During this time, be fully committed to the
<br>system. At the end of six months, notice the improvement and compare it to the old
<br>methods. You will be pleasantly surprised.
<br>You will, finally, develop the ability to speak effortless English. The words will
<br>come out automatically. The grammar will improve automatically. The feelings of
<br>confidence will appear automatically.
<br>Welcome to Effortless English™.
<br>In the final section of this book I will discuss advanced topics and common
<br>questions. However, you should not focus on these advanced methods until you have
<br>spent at least six months using the core Effortless English™ system as described.
<br>Most learners will only need this core system.
<br>LEARNING ENGLISH ONLINE
<br>As I noted earlier, the web now has everything you need to learn English
<br>online. You can buy English lessons, find a private teacher, use a translation
<br>dictionary, save and review new words, improve your English grammar, and chat
<br>with other English students. All of this, you can do online. This has been great for
<br>language learners. Even students who find it difficult to get regular access to
<br>native English speakers can now hear and speak English every day by simply
<br>logging onto the Internet. Here are some of my recommendations on getting the
<br>best from the web:
<br>Download MP3 English Lessons From The Internet Your first step is to find
<br>natural English courses online. You want lessons that use real English, not
<br>grammar or reading lessons. You also want audio lessons, not textbooks.
<br>Audio lessons have several advantages. One advantage is that you
<br>download them immediately. Another advantage is that they are portable –
<br>simply put the lessons on your phone or audio player and you can learn
<br>English anywhere, anytime. As you know, audio lessons in general are much
<br>more effective than written textbooks.
<br>Find An Online English Community There’s no need to pay for an expensive
<br>tutor or English school. You can find English conversation partners online,
<br>often at very reasonable prices. Most conversation partners use voice chat
<br>programs which make it easy to talk to anyone in the world for free. Thus, you
<br>can easily find a native speaker or an advanced English learner – no matter
<br>where you live. Some people use video chat – even better!
<br>A community also gives you support and encouragement. You’ll get great
<br>ideas from other learners. You’ll also make new friends from all over the
<br>world. Members of Effortless English™ courses automatically join our
<br>international online community and can use our forums and social site.
<br>Online English Dictionary and Word Saver As you use your English lessons,
<br>you’ll sometimes want to look up new words in a dictionary or find a
<br>translation in your language. Online dictionaries are simply great – much
<br>faster than text.
<br>You will need two types of dictionaries. The first is a standard dictionary.
<br>This can be a translation dictionary for your own language or you can use an
<br>English-only version. The other type of dictionary you need is an idiomatic
<br>dictionary. As you might guess, this type of dictionary contains the common
<br>English idioms (phrases) you won’t find in a standard dictionary.
<br>Audio and Video The Internet is a buffet of authentic audio and video material.
<br>As I noted in a previous chapter, you can find podcasts and audio books on
<br>virtually any topic with a simple Internet search. You can watch American and
<br>British movies and television on a variety of websites as well.
<br>More advanced students can listen to copies of actual conversations. These
<br>are best for learners who need to understand casual speech.
<br>CHAPTER 17
<br>The Power of Pleasure Reading
<br>You are using the Effortless English™ system every day. You focus most of your
<br>time on listening to compelling stories. You listen to point-of-view stories to learn
<br>grammar naturally. You learn deeply. As a result, your English speaking is
<br>improving. Each month you speak more easily and effortlessly. Your confidence is
<br>growing. You are mastering the core, high-frequency English used most commonly
<br>by native speakers.
<br>As you continue improving, eventually you will want to advance to a higher level
<br>of English. Perhaps you want to study abroad in America or Canada. Perhaps you
<br>want to work for an international company that requires English. Perhaps you need
<br>to pass an exam such as the TOEFL, TOEIC, or IELTS.
<br>When you reach this point, what is the best way to improve your English reading?
<br>How can you learn to read faster? How can you use reading to learn more words
<br>faster? How can you improve your reading comprehension? What’s the best way to
<br>combine reading and listening?
<br>Most schools teach reading using an academic skill-building approach. Typically,
<br>students read difficult articles and then answer questions about them to test their
<br>comprehension. Students are taught how to identify the main idea of the article, how
<br>to answer multiple choice questions about the article, and how to guess the meaning
<br>of unknown words. They are then graded on their performance.
<br>During my teaching career, I have found that most students are bored by this
<br>approach. Worse, a tremendous amount of research shows that this method is
<br>inferior to one that is much more enjoyable and natural. Students who use this
<br>natural method write better, have better vocabularies, have better grammar
<br>comprehension and perform better on the TOEFL test than those who use the
<br>traditional methods found in schools and textbooks.
<br>Just what is this powerful natural method? The research is clear that simply
<br>eading for pleasure is the most effective reading method of all. In other words, all
<br>you need to do is read interesting and fairly easy books in English. No exercises are
<br>necessary. No tests are necessary. No complex reading strategies are necessary. No
<br>lessons are necessary. No required books are necessary.
<br>Easy High Volume Pleasure Reading
<br>There is no big secret to reading in English. In fact, the answer couldn’t be simpler.
<br>You need to read books (in English) that are interesting and fairly easy to you. You
<br>need to read them every day and you need to read a lot of them.
<br>It turns out that volume is the key to improvements with reading. In other words,
<br>the key to better English reading is to read more pages every day, and more books
<br>every month. Choosing extremely difficult books is counter-productive. Some
<br>learners think they’ll improve faster by reading difficult material but the opposite is
<br>true. The best reading materials are ones you can read without the use of a
<br>dictionary.
<br>Compelling content is also vital. You must choose books that are extremely
<br>interesting to you. Of course, this will be different for everyone. If you love science,
<br>then you should read easy books about science and science fiction. If you love
<br>omance, then you should read easy romance books. If you love comic books, then
<br>ead your favorite comic books in English!
<br>In the beginning, you may need to read books that are designed for young adults.
<br>Read as many as you can every week. The more you read compelling material, the
<br>faster your reading will become and the faster it will improve. Soon you’ll be
<br>eading novels and non-fiction books that are designed for adults.
<br>Kill Two Birds With One Stone
<br>The very best approach to pleasure reading is to combine it with listening. When
<br>you listen and read at the same time, you “kill two birds with one stone.” In other
<br>words, you accomplish two goals at the same time: you improve your listening (and
<br>thus your speaking) and you improve your reading ability.
<br>Whenever possible, get the audiobook version of the book you are reading. Be
<br>sure to get the “unabridged” audiobook. The unabridged version will have every
<br>word of the book — in audio form. You’ll then be able to listen to each chapter as
<br>you read along at the same time. By doing this, you’ll automatically learn the
<br>correct pronunciation of new words you encounter. You’ll also learn to read a bit
<br>faster as you must follow along with a native speaker who is reading the book aloud
<br>for you.
<br>Combined listening and reading will build both your written and your spoken
<br>vocabulary. You will continue learning new English phrases from real natural
<br>materials at a more advanced level. As your English ability becomes more
<br>advanced, novels, nonfiction books and audiobooks will become increasingly
<br>important. At the advanced level, you’ll spend most of your time reading and
<br>listening to books that are compelling to you.
<br>It’s as simple as that! Read what you love and read a lot. Listen to the audiobook
<br>version whenever possible. This is the fastest and most enjoyable way to improve
<br>your English reading. As we’ll see in the next chapter, it’s also an excellent way to
<br>improve your writing.
<br>For Practice
<br>Go online and buy an English language novel for young adults. I recommend
<br>starting with a series of books such as “The Hardy Boys” or “Nancy Drew.”
<br>Read one chapter in the book each day. On a calendar, track the number of pages
<br>you read.
<br>After one week, increase average daily page count. Read a little more. Your goal
<br>every week is to read more pages than you read in the previous week.
<br>When you finish the first book, read another in the series. Continue reading
<br>books in the series until you have completed all of them. You will then be ready for
<br>somewhat more difficult material.
<br>Of course, get the audio versions of your books whenever possible.
<br>CHAPTER 18
<br>The Secret To Good English Writing
<br>Years ago, I was teaching an advanced writing class in San Francisco. My students
<br>were foreign learners who hoped to enter an American university. They had just
<br>finished writing an essay about why they wanted to study in the USA.
<br>Each student handed me their paper and then walked out of class. I sat down,
<br>grabbed the first one, and began to read. I read the first paragraph and was
<br>completely confused. The introduction was a mess. The sentences were extremely
<br>long and complex and were written in the passive voice. The vocabulary was
<br>complex and was used incorrectly.
<br>As I continued to read, I was horrified. The student’s essay was unintelligible. I
<br>couldn’t even understand his main idea. Frustrated, I put the paper aside and grabbed
<br>another. I began to read the second essay and encountered the exact same problems.
<br>Once again there were long complex sentences that were impossible to follow or
<br>understand. Once again the student used complex vocabulary that was inappropriate
<br>and used incorrectly. Once again I had no idea what she was trying to say.
<br>Bewildered, I went through every essay and found the same problems in each of
<br>them: convoluted sentences, overly complex vocabulary, overuse of the passive
<br>voice, and no clear message or point. The essays were unreadable.
<br>“What a mess,” I said to myself as I put down the last paper.
<br>The Problem of Academic Writing
<br>Why were these essays so bad, and why were they bad in such similar ways? The
<br>answer lies, again, with the hidden curriculum of schools. Each of my students had
<br>learned English writing in school. In their classes, they had been taught an academic
<br>style of writing that emphasized complex sentences, complex vocabulary, and the
<br>passive voice.
<br>Both teachers and students use this style of writing in an attempt to sound
<br>intellectual. The truth is, however, that most academic writing is terrible. Academic
<br>journals, for example, are filled with convoluted sentences that seem designed to be
<br>as confusing as possible. Students, influenced by their professors, attempt to model
<br>this kind of writing. As my San Francisco class showed, the results are typically
<br>disastrous.
<br>Write Like Hemingway
<br>In contrast to academics, Nobel prize-winning writer Ernest Hemingway was
<br>famous for his simple, direct style of writing. Hemingway typically used short
<br>sentences, simple phrases, and common vocabulary to create beautiful and powerful
<br>stories.
<br>Though you are unlikely to write as well as Hemingway, his general style of
<br>writing is the best one to use. Most English learners write badly because they make
<br>their writing overly complex. They are trying to sound “intellectual” but instead end
<br>up sounding unintelligible. The solution is to write more conversationally. In other
<br>words, write like you speak.
<br>Conversational writing is similar to (though not exactly the same) as speaking.
<br>When you speak English, you likely use clear, simple, direct sentences. You express
<br>your ideas as simply as possible.
<br>Short, direct sentences are best. Break long sentences into a series of short,
<br>simple sentences. In most cases, use the active voice rather than the passive. Model
<br>your writing on journalists and Hemingway rather than on professors, journal
<br>articles, or other academic material.
<br>Good writing is a process of cutting and simplifying. Your goal, therefore, is to
<br>communicate your ideas using as few words as possible. The simpler you make
<br>your writing, the more clear and powerful it will be.
<br>How To Develop Your English Writing
<br>So how do you develop a simple, conversational, and direct writing style? It turns
<br>out you already know the answer! In the last chapter we discussed the importance of
<br>pleasure reading. The research shows that this kind of reading is not only a great
<br>way to improve your reading speed, reading comprehension, and vocabulary — it’s
<br>also the best way to improve your writing.
<br>Just as listening is the key to speaking, reading is the key to writing. The same
<br>principle applies: Understandable, compelling input is the foundation for effective
<br>output. In other words, listening is the foundation for speaking and reading is the
<br>foundation for writing.
<br>Just as you focused on fairly easy listening to improve your speaking, you’ll
<br>focus on fairly easy reading to improve your writing. Just as you focused on
<br>listening to real stories and authentic audios to master English speaking, you’ll read
<br>stories and authentic books to master English writing. You needed a lot of listening
<br>to speak effortlessly and you’ll now need a lot of reading in order to write
<br>effortlessly.
<br>This is why your number one activity for writing is reading. Nothing beats highvolume
<br>pleasure reading for improving written grammar, written vocabulary,
<br>sentence structure, spelling, and clarity. The more you read for pleasure, the more
<br>you intuitively absorb English sentence structures. In other words, you learn to write
<br>best by modeling your writing after good writers. The best way to imitate good
<br>writers is to read their books.
<br>Remember, when it comes to pleasure reading, the amount is what is most
<br>important. Your goal is to constantly increase the number of pages you read in
<br>English every week. Read novels that you love. Read non-fiction books that
<br>fascinate you. Read comic books. Read simple articles. It’s the amount you read that
<br>is most important, not how difficult it is. In fact, easier material is usually best,
<br>especially for the purpose of improving your writing.
<br>Daily Writing Practice: Speed Writing
<br>Too many English learners focus themselves on writing academic essays. As noted
<br>previously, these kinds of essays are often overly complex. Even when well written,
<br>academic writing is challenging and is one of the most advanced levels of writing.
<br>This is why most learners benefit by first focusing on simpler forms of writing.
<br>One of the best ways to do this is to write a daily journal. Daily journal writing
<br>helps you to improve sentence structure, write faster and write more clearly.
<br>The key to journal writing is to keep it short and simple. Each day, choose one
<br>clear topic to write about. You might write about something you did the day before.
<br>You might write about one of your goals. You could write about something you
<br>ecently read, communicating your thoughts or feelings about it.
<br>The next step is to set a timer, with an alarm, for ten minutes. When you are ready
<br>to begin, press “start” on the timer and write as quickly as possible. The most
<br>important point is to never take a break. You must write during the entire ten
<br>minutes without pausing. Do not pause to think of what to write next. Do not pause to
<br>correct mistakes. Do not pause to think of a better phrase. Do not let your hand stop
<br>moving — continue writing anything that comes into your head for the entire ten
<br>minutes.
<br>This technique is called “timed writing” and is commonly used by professional
<br>authors. By writing quickly, without pausing, you bypass your critical brain and
<br>learn to let the words flow out. When you first try this you will probably feel
<br>frustrated. You’ll struggle to think of what to write. Your writing will be
<br>disorganized. You’ll make a lot of mistakes. Don’t worry.
<br>As you continue doing timed writings each day, you will improve. Your writing
<br>speed and fluency will get faster. You’ll find yourself naturally using phrases that
<br>you read in a book or article. Because you are writing fast, you’ll be forced to write
<br>more simply. You won’t have time to think about grammar rules.
<br>Week by week, your sentence structure will improve. Perhaps more importantly,
<br>your confidence with English writing will improve. If you feel confident enough,
<br>you could post your journal publicly online by writing it as a blog. Each day,
<br>publish a new post of your timed writing.
<br>Rewriting Is The Secret To Good Writing
<br>Reading for pleasure and daily timed writing are the foundation of your English
<br>writing practice. However, you will not become a great writer by only using these
<br>two methods. In fact, your timed writings will probably never be great. They’ll
<br>always have mistakes and problems, and that’s fine.
<br>In fact, your imperfect journal writing will be in good company. This is a secret
<br>that few writers discuss, but all know: almost all first drafts are bad! In other words,
<br>even professional native speakers, who get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars
<br>for their books, can write badly. All writers make grammar mistakes. All writers
<br>make spelling mistakes.
<br>Great writers know that the secret to good writing is rewriting. You see, with
<br>writing we have a great advantage compared to speaking. We have time. You have
<br>time to read what you wrote. You have time to identify your mistakes. You have time
<br>to correct those mistakes. You have time to completely rewrite everything. You even
<br>have time to show your writing to other people and get their help!
<br>For casual writing, such as a blog post or email, it’s not usually necessary to
<br>ewrite. However, for important communication such as business proposals, school
<br>essays, important emails, professional articles, etc., rewriting is absolutely essential.
<br>The good news is that you don’t need to write perfectly. It is acceptable to make
<br>mistakes in your first draft. We all do. It’s even acceptable for your first draft to be
<br>terrible. With writing, only the final draft is essential and it must be mistake free.
<br>You create your great final draft through the editing process. First, use timed
<br>writing to quickly write your first draft. Get your ideas on paper. Make mistakes.
<br>Just write quickly.
<br>Once you have the first draft, you have something to work with. Think of
<br>yourself as a sculptor and the first draft is your clay. Read the draft, imagining
<br>yourself as the final reader (your audience). Are the ideas clear? Is everything stated
<br>as directly as possible? What’s confusing? Are the ideas well organized?
<br>Undoubtedly, you will find many problems. That’s when you rewrite. Correct the
<br>problems. Cut the mistakes. Rewrite whole sections, or the whole thing, if necessary.
<br>Your focus is to make the second draft simpler, clearer and more direct.
<br>When you finish your second draft, save it and put it aside. If possible, wait a day
<br>and then reread it. Again imagine you are the final reader. Look for overly complex
<br>sentences. Look for unclear ideas. Fix the problems again and rewrite for the second
<br>time.
<br>For many kinds of writing, two rewrites will be enough. However, if the writing
<br>is particularly important, you’ll need to do more. For this kind of writing, it’s best
<br>to get outside help from an editor. Your editor might be a friend, or a tutor, or even
<br>a paid professional. This person will read your third draft and offer advice. Ask
<br>them to quickly rewrite any sections that are problematic.
<br>Working with an editor will help you create the best writing possible. It’s not
<br>always necessary, but do it whenever you can, and carefully notice their rewrite
<br>suggestions.
<br>After a few rewrites with your editor, you’ll be ready to publish what you have
<br>written. Before you do so, be sure to use spell check to catch spelling mistakes you
<br>may have missed.
<br>For Practice
<br>Do a ten minute timed writing exercise every day. During this time, write as quickly
<br>as possible without stopping.
<br>The next day, reread the previous day’s journal entry. Quickly identify problems
<br>and mistakes. Rewrite your journal entry to make it clearer. Cut out anything that is
<br>unnecessary.
<br>On day three, you’ll go back to step one and do another timed writing. Continue
<br>following this pattern, alternating timed writing with rewrites.
<br>CHAPTER 19
<br>Why You Should Not Practice Speaking
<br>During my first English teaching job in Korea, I worked with a staff member
<br>named Seo. Seo worked in the sales office of the school. His job was to convince
<br>parents to enroll their children. Seo was an energetic and friendly guy. He was also
<br>determined to improve his English, which wasn’t great.
<br>Since Seo worked at an English school which employed over twenty native
<br>speakers, his strategy was to “practice” his English with us at every opportunity.
<br>Each day Seo would look for one of the teachers. When he’d find one, he’d corner
<br>them and talk as much as he could using broken English. He was especially
<br>interested in idioms and made a great effort to use them during these chats.
<br>During my year in Korea, I was cornered by Seo many times. Though he was a
<br>likable person, I quickly began to dread my encounters with him. The other teachers
<br>felt the same. Whenever we saw Seo, we walked the other way. No one wanted to
<br>talk to him!
<br>What was happening? Were we being mean? The truth is, we avoided Seo because
<br>he was trying to use us as free English tutors. Rather than communicate with us as
<br>friends, he “practiced” English on us. He asked us to correct his mistakes. He asked
<br>us to confirm that he was using idioms correctly. He asked for pronunciation advice.
<br>Chats with Seo soon felt like teaching an English class rather than communicating
<br>with a friend.
<br>By seeing us merely as practice opportunities, Seo killed the possibility for a true
<br>friendship. We felt he was trying to use us. Conversations with him were unnatural
<br>and annoying because his focus was solely on the English language rather than on
<br>true communication.
<br>Because of this approach, Seo never made friends with any of the teachers.
<br>Ironically, had he just talked to us as people, without focusing on English, he would
<br>have easily made a number of English-speaking friends. He would have had the
<br>opportunity for many more real conversations.
<br>Unfortunately, Seo is not unique. Many learners are obsessed with “practicing”
<br>their English. Because their focus is on practice, these learners search desperately
<br>for “conversation partners.” Yet, by insisting that others correct their mistakes or
<br>offer English advice, these learners usually drive away native speakers who would
<br>otherwise be happy to chat with them.
<br>This is why you must not try to “practice” English with native speakers. Instead of
<br>practicing, simply focus on being a true friend. Communicate, without focusing on
<br>the English language. Talk about your shared interests. Ask questions and listen to
<br>their answers. Show your appreciation and understanding. In other words, treat them
<br>just as you would a friend who speaks your own language.
<br>One of the best ways to do this is to meet people who share a common passion.
<br>For example, if you love movies, join online forums dedicated to movie lovers.
<br>Join international fan clubs dedicated to your favorite movies or musicians. Connect
<br>with others who share a hobby with you.
<br>When you communicate with these people, talk about your shared passion. Never
<br>ask them to correct your English. Don’t apologize for your English. Don’t ask for
<br>any English advice at all. They are not your English teachers, they are your friends.
<br>You’ll learn far more by just chatting with them than by trying to make them your
<br>personal tutor.
<br>Error Correction Is Useless Anyway
<br>A meta research study at the University of Southern California found that error
<br>correction has no impact at all on spoken English. In other words, students whose
<br>verbal errors were corrected showed no improvement, and were similar to students
<br>who were not corrected. The conclusion: verbal error correction is useless.
<br>In fact, it’s worse than useless. Error correction harms you by forcing you to
<br>constantly think about grammar. Instead of focusing on communicating your ideas,
<br>you increasingly focus on just the language itself. Doing so usually leads to more
<br>anxiety, which we know slows your learning and harms your performance. This is
<br>why you must never ask a teacher or friend to correct your spoken English. It is a
<br>waste of their time and yours. Error correction will also poison your relationship
<br>with English speakers and drive them away, just as Seo annoyed the teachers at the
<br>school in Korea.
<br>This truth is a difficult one for many learners. Yet the research is clear. You will
<br>get no benefit from having your spoken errors corrected (note that writing is
<br>different because it is a slow process that can be done consciously and
<br>methodically). So rather than ask for error correction, ask others to avoid
<br>correcting your errors. If you pay a conversation partner, ask them to avoid
<br>correcting your mistakes. If they notice an error, ask them to simply restate the idea
<br>using correct English. By hearing your idea restated correctly, you’ll intuitively
<br>learn to improve without thinking consciously about English.
<br>Listen During Most Of Your Speaking Time
<br>When thinking of conversations, most learners focus on speech. They worry about
<br>speaking correctly. They worry about remembering vocabulary words. They fear
<br>making mistakes. In my experience, most English learners focus 90% of their
<br>energy on speaking.
<br>Yet, the true power of real life conversations comes from listening, not speaking.
<br>Think about it. When you talk to a native speaker you have a tremendous
<br>opportunity. Because they are a native speaker, they are automatically the best
<br>possible source for authentic spoken English. They will naturally use highfrequency
<br>phrases, idioms, slang and grammar.
<br>If, during a conversation with a native speaker, you spend most of the time
<br>speaking — you have missed a great opportunity. When you speak to a native
<br>speaker, how exactly are you learning? You might get a little practice, but you will
<br>not learn anything new.
<br>On the other hand, as you listen to a native speaker you get a wealth of learning.
<br>You’ll hear true native pronunciation. You’ll learn natural phrases. You’ll learn new
<br>words. You’ll learn idioms and slang. In fact, most of the benefit of having English
<br>conversations happens when you are listening.
<br>This is good news, because most people love to talk. You don’t need to feel
<br>stressed about talking with a native speaker because it’s very easy. All you have to
<br>do is ask them a lot of questions. Ask them about their life. Ask about their job or
<br>school. Ask about their family. Ask about their hobbies and interests. Ask about their
<br>past experiences.
<br>Then listen. Listen carefully. As they speak, look at their eyes and the rest of their
<br>face. Seek to understand as well as possible. If you don’t understand something, ask
<br>more questions for clarification.
<br>When your goal is to listen rather than talk, you’ll learn more English and you
<br>will also be a better friend. Everybody loves a good listener! The added benefit to
<br>you is that you can relax. You don’t need to feel pressured to speak. With a few
<br>simple questions you will have all the conversations you want.
<br>Mini Story Retells
<br>We have discussed natural conversation situations and how to approach them. In this
<br>last section, I’ll teach you how to practice speaking and improve your
<br>pronunciation. Though you’ll always spend the vast majority of your time listening,
<br>advanced learners can also benefit from a little bit of speaking practice daily.
<br>Speaking practice is only recommended for advanced learners who are already
<br>speaking effortlessly. At that point, you are ready to work on your pronunciation
<br>and speed.
<br>One of the easiest ways to practice speaking is to do mini story retells. As the
<br>name suggests, you will use the same mini stories described in Rule Seven: listen
<br>and answer mini stories. You will continue listening to the stories daily. You’ll
<br>continue shouting your answers to the questions.
<br>Then you will add this next step. After you finish listening to the story, turn off
<br>the audio. Stand in front of a mirror. Get yourself into a peak emotional state —
<br>jump, shout, smile. Get energized!
<br>When feeling great, retell the mini story you just heard. Do not try to tell the story
<br>exactly, word for word. Do not try to memorize it word for word. Rather, as quickly
<br>as possible, retell the story using your own words. You can even change the story if
<br>you want.
<br>The most important point is to do this quickly. Strive for speed! In a loud and
<br>energetic voice, tell the story to yourself in the mirror. This will only take you a few
<br>minutes. When you finish, take a short break and then repeat the process again. Try
<br>to retell the story even faster the next time.
<br>The purpose of fast retells is to bypass your logical (and slow) left brain. By
<br>speaking quickly, you are forced to speak more naturally and more intuitively. As
<br>you do this daily, your fluency will increase. You’ll speak faster without effort.
<br>English will flow out of you more and more easily. At this point, you are ready for
<br>the final step: pronunciation.
<br>Pronunciation Retells
<br>Earlier in the book, I described the movie technique and taught you a method for
<br>using it to improve pronunciation. You can use a similar technique with mini story
<br>etells.
<br>First, repeat the steps in the previous section. Do a few fast retells of the story.
<br>When you can do that easily, it’s time to work on pronunciation.
<br>Play one sentence from the mini story and then pause the audio. As you play this
<br>sentence, listen very closely. Focus especially on the rhythm and intonation. Notice
<br>when the speaker pauses. Notice when the speaker ’s voice goes up and when it goes
<br>down. Notice when it gets louder and when it gets softer.
<br>Then say the same sentence and copy the speaker ’s voice exactly. Again, imagine
<br>you are an actor trying to exactly imitate this speaker. Use their voice. Use their
<br>emotion. Even use your face and body as you imagine the speaker would. Try to
<br>become this person as you speak.
<br>Then play the next sentence and pause, repeating the process. In this way, go
<br>through the entire mini story. Be sure to mimic both the questions and the answers.
<br>Of course, it’s best to choose a speaker that you like!
<br>Using the methods in this chapter, you will take your speaking to an advanced,
<br>near-native level.
<br>CHAPTER 20
<br>English Is The Language Of
<br>International Business
<br>A few years ago I was reviewing business proposals. Our company needed new
<br>graphics for our website, so I had posted a job on an international freelancer forum.
<br>We got over twenty responses to our job posting. Each posting contained a bid for
<br>our project.
<br>As I reviewed the bids, I noticed the nationalities of the graphic artists. There was
<br>a company from Argentina. There was an artist from Hungary. There was a
<br>Japanese bidder. There was a German and a Malaysian. There were several from the
<br>United States and Canada.
<br>As I looked them over, I was struck by this clear example of globalization. These
<br>people were all participating in an online international marketplace. Then I realized
<br>the obvious: they were all using English to do so. Every bid was written in English.
<br>Therefore, each of these artists was competing not only based on their artistic
<br>ability, but also on their ability to communicate their strengths in English.
<br>Clearly, English is the international language of business. It is for this reason that
<br>schools, everywhere in the world, offer English classes. English language ability is
<br>a competitive advantage to any and all who have it. English opens the world, to
<br>companies and freelance artists alike. Lack of English closes opportunities and puts
<br>you at a disadvantage in our global economy.
<br>These are simply the facts, be they pleasant to you or not. The simple truth is that
<br>English is growing increasingly important to the global economy. More and more
<br>jobs, in more and more countries, are requiring spoken English proficiency. Some
<br>companies, such as the Japanese company Rakuten, are making English their
<br>official language.
<br>Rakuten’s founder and CEO Hiroshi Mikitani created an English-only policy for
<br>the web commerce company. Mr. Mikitani said “one of the things holding back
<br>Japanese firms from competing globally is a language barrier that prevents them
<br>from fully grasping overseas competition.” He also said that lack of English
<br>proficiency limits Japanese companies from pursuing global talent and retaining
<br>non-Japanese staff.
<br>With the new policy, all employees are required to use English for company
<br>communications, including meetings, presentations, emails, proposals, and other
<br>documents. The company expects employees to be proactive about learning English
<br>independently.
<br>While this is a developing trend for Japan, many international companies are
<br>increasing their requirements for English. Many, like Rakuten, are instituting
<br>English-only policies. As this trend grows, the demand for business English grows
<br>with it.
<br>Increasingly, in the business world there is simply no escape from English.
<br>It’s Still English
<br>Business English opens economic opportunities. Because of this, a large variety of
<br>business English classes, schools, textbooks and lessons have arrived to fill the
<br>need. Not surprisingly, most of these use the same old methods to teach business
<br>English as they used to teach general English.
<br>Business English, however, is not a separate type of English. The happy truth is
<br>that most of the English used in business situations is the same English used
<br>commonly in other situations. In business, you’ll find the same common
<br>vocabulary, the same common idioms, and the same grammar.
<br>The main addition to business English is simply vocabulary related to specific
<br>business topics. This vocabulary falls into two categories: general business terms
<br>and specialized jargon.
<br>General business terms are those used throughout the business world. These are
<br>common phrases often used in meetings, proposals, and presentations. These are
<br>quite easy to learn, using the same Effortless English™ methods you are already
<br>using.
<br>The Easy Way To Learn Business English
<br>Learning business English is simply a matter of selecting real materials that are
<br>elated to business topics. In other words, you use the exact same Effortless
<br>English™ method.
<br>First you focus on fuel, your psychology. You change your limiting beliefs. You
<br>put yourself into a peak emotional state. Then you use the seven Rules. You spend
<br>most of your time listening. You learn deeply. You avoid grammar books and
<br>textbooks. You listen to mini stories and point of view stories — choosing stories
<br>about business topics that use business English vocabulary.
<br>For extra listening, listen to real business English materials such as business
<br>podcasts, business newscasts, and business audiobooks. When possible, get both the
<br>text and audio versions. Read and listen simultaneously.
<br>Just as you did with general English, choose materials that are interesting to you.
<br>If you are a salesperson, choose materials related to sales. If your area is finance,
<br>then focus on audios and text related to finance.
<br>You have nothing special to do. Just follow the same Effortless English™ system,
<br>using business materials.
<br>Learn Specialized Jargon Last
<br>Some fields of business have a large number of specialized words. This specialized
<br>vocabulary is called “jargon.” For example, accountants have a large number of
<br>accounting terms which are used extensively in their jobs. This specialized
<br>vocabulary is vital for accountants.
<br>While necessary, jargon is the final type of business English you will learn.
<br>Before learning jargon you should first focus on general business English. Master
<br>the most common business phrases by listening to and reading real business content.
<br>Only after you have done this should you concern yourself with jargon.
<br>Of course, you’ll learn your field’s jargon in exactly the same way as you learned
<br>general business English. When you are ready, simply change the material you are
<br>listening to and reading. Gather real materials that are specifically related to your
<br>field.
<br>Choose material that is useful. Rather than focusing on the English, focus on
<br>learning more about your field from English sources. Develop your knowledge and
<br>skills using these sources and you’ll automatically improve your business English
<br>at the same time.
<br>CHAPTER 21
<br>How To Give Powerful English Presentations
<br>I was standing at the side of a stage, waiting to give my first public speech to a
<br>group of thirty people. My heart was beating quickly. My breathing was tight and
<br>shallow. My entire body felt jittery. I looked down at my hands and they were
<br>shaking. I tried to control the shaking, but failed. I thought to myself, “What if I
<br>forget everything and freeze?”
<br>Suddenly, I heard my name as I was introduced to the audience. I walked onto the
<br>stage. The audience applauded but I couldn’t hear them. I glanced up and viewed
<br>them through tunnel vision. My sight was narrowed and my peripheral vision had
<br>turned black.
<br>As I started to speak, I felt my throat tighten. My voice sounded strange — high
<br>pitched and weak. I fixed my gaze on the wall at the back of the room and rapidly
<br>gave my presentation. My only goal was to finish as fast as possible and get off that
<br>stage. Though the speech was only three minutes long, it felt like hours.
<br>When I finished, I rushed quickly off the stage and sat down. My hands were still
<br>shaking uncontrollably.
<br>Few activities are as terrifying as public speaking. Speeches are continually
<br>anked as one of the most feared and stressful life experiences — dreaded by nearly
<br>all people. This nerve-wracking experience is made even more difficult when
<br>English is not your native language.
<br>When you feel fear, you have both a mental and a physical reaction. It is the
<br>physical reactions that are particularly difficult to handle. When terrified, your body
<br>produces an adrenaline response. The adrenal glands release adrenaline into your
<br>blood, preparing you for “fight or flight.”
<br>The physical responses to adrenaline are fairly consistent and predictable and
<br>include sweating, increased heartbeat, shallow rapid breathing, muscle tension,
<br>shaking, upset stomach, tunnel vision, and loss of fine muscle control.
<br>Adrenaline produces mental changes as well. Your sense of time changes. Most
<br>people experience a “slowing down” of time while some experience “time speeding
<br>up.” Worst of all for speakers, adrenaline causes your higher brain activities to
<br>slow. Brain activity shifts to the more primitive and emotional sections of the brain.
<br>This is why you can speak perfectly well to one person but struggle terribly when
<br>speaking in front of a group. Your brain is not working as well.
<br>Clearly the great challenge with public speaking is overcoming these fear
<br>eactions.
<br>Psychology Is Eighty Percent Of Success
<br>I could hear the crowd of three thousand in the room next door. Loud rock music
<br>echoed through the venue. A buzz of energy grew as the event organizer began my
<br>introduction.
<br>Backstage, my excitement built. I jumped, shouted and smiled. I yelled to myself,
<br>“I am here to contribute! I will give all my energy and ability to help this audience
<br>today! I’m ready to rock! Yes! Yes! Yes!”
<br>I walked to the door and peeked through it to view the audience. They were
<br>standing on their feet, applauding. And then they began to chant my name. “A.J.
<br>Hoge! A.J. Hoge! A.J. Hoge!” A surge of energy went through my body. I jumped
<br>and then ran onto the stage. The audience continued to shout my name.
<br>As I stood facing that audience of three thousand people, I felt no fear. My
<br>eathing was deep, my body relaxed. In place of fear, I felt tremendous enthusiasm.
<br>In place of nervousness, I felt eagerness instead.
<br>My experience of public speaking has totally transformed. Before a big speech, I
<br>now feel powerful — an incredible mix of confidence, excitement, and enthusiasm.
<br>How did I make such a dramatic change? I did it using a few simple techniques,
<br>practiced hundreds of times.
<br>The good news is that you can do what I have done. No matter how much fear you
<br>have for English presentations, by practicing a simple technique you can train
<br>yourself to feel strong and confident every time you give a public speech.
<br>Feeling strong and confident is eighty percent or more of public speaking
<br>success. You already know how to speak. Once you overcome the fear of public
<br>speaking, you won’t have any problem making great English presentations.
<br>Confidence Must Be Trained
<br>Confidence does not just happen accidentally. To overcome the fear of public
<br>speaking, you must develop emotional mastery at a very high level. Doing that
<br>equires practice and training. Great speakers train constantly.
<br>You will use a very basic technique to achieve the emotional mastery necessary
<br>for public speaking. This technique is designed to overcome the natural fear
<br>esponse and replace it with feelings of confidence.
<br>For this technique to be successful, you must practice it many times before giving
<br>a speech. Ideally, you will repeat this technique hundreds of times before taking the
<br>stage. You’ll do this before each and every speech you ever make.
<br>You Can’t Suppress Fear, You Can Only Transform It
<br>The adrenaline response is powerful. Once it is triggered, it is almost impossible to
<br>suppress. You can’t fight it. In fact, any attempt to suppress the fear will make it
<br>worse.
<br>For example, if your hands begin to shake before giving a speech, it is nearly
<br>impossible to stop them. The same is true for a rapid heartbeat, shallow breathing,
<br>muscle tension, etc. Once these reactions have started, they can’t be fought. The
<br>adrenaline is already in your blood and your body will respond. If you try to fight
<br>against the reactions, you’ll grow frustrated by your inability to change them. Your
<br>fear will multiply as you realize you are not in control, and the symptoms will
<br>worsen.
<br>Once the adrenaline response is triggered, you have only one choice — channel
<br>the energy into something positive. Remember the purpose of adrenaline — it
<br>prepares you for flight or fight. This means you can use the same fear/flight
<br>eactions to create courage and fighting spirit instead. This is how I transformed my
<br>own fear of public speaking.
<br>By using the energy instead of resisting it, you make yourself into a dynamic and
<br>confident speaker. The physical responses of fear and excitement are nearly
<br>identical. When you are excited your heartbeat increases, your breathing gets faster,
<br>and your muscles tension increases. When extremely excited, you may sweat and
<br>your hands may shake. In other words, your body reacts the same. So what makes
<br>the difference between extreme fear and extreme excitement?
<br>It is the thoughts and feelings you attach to the physical reactions that determine
<br>whether you experience fear or excitement. By connecting positive experiences to
<br>the physical sensations, you will train yourself to feel excited and powerful rather
<br>than afraid.
<br>How To Convert Fear Into Power
<br>We will once again return to the technique of anchoring to program your brain for
<br>public-speaking confidence.
<br>The first step is to recreate, as best you can, the physical sensations of fear. You
<br>want to get your heart beating faster. You want to increase your breathing. You want
<br>to tighten your muscles. The easiest way to do this is to use the peak state exercise
<br>you learned in the beginning of this book.
<br>Put on your favorite loud, high-energy music. As you listen to this music, begin
<br>to jump and move your body. Little by little, jump higher and jump faster. Put a huge
<br>smile on your face. Make strong powerful gestures with your arms. Shout aloud,
<br>“Yes! Yes! Yes!” Keep going until your heart is beating fast and you are breathing
<br>heavily.
<br>Turn off the music and, while still breathing heavily, begin to talk about your
<br>topic. Talk about the main ideas. If you have already planned the speech, do the
<br>whole thing. As you talk, move your body. Walk from one point of the room to
<br>another. Use strong gestures to make your point. Continue to smile.
<br>At first this will likely be difficult, as you’ll be out of breath. Your heart will be
<br>beating fast and it may be difficult to think of your speech. It’s okay. Continue
<br>smiling and do the best you can. When you finish, turn on the music again and
<br>epeat the entire process.
<br>Repeat this exercise at least four times a day. Each day, try to get your heart
<br>beating even faster before you practice your speech.
<br>This exercise accomplishes several things. First, you create a positive anchor. By
<br>playing music you love and jumping and having fun, you generate strong positive
<br>emotions. Feeling great, you then begin your speech. With repetition, these great
<br>feelings become connected to the act of giving a speech. Eventually, just thinking
<br>about doing a presentation will make you feel excited automatically.
<br>This exercise also trains you to deal with the major symptoms of nervousness:
<br>fast heartbeat, fast breathing, sweating, etc. Most people practice a speech when they
<br>are feeling calm. Because they always practice in a calm emotional state, they are
<br>unready for the flood of emotions that come just before the real speech. By
<br>practicing with an elevated heart and breathing rate, you are training your mind to
<br>expect these reactions and handle them. On the day of the speech, you won’t get
<br>scared by these symptoms because they’ll be normal and familiar to you. Instead,
<br>you’ll be used to channeling this physical energy into positive emotions and strong
<br>actions.
<br>This is the difference between training and practicing. Those who practice simply
<br>eview their speech. Those who train do their best to recreate the emotional and
<br>physical conditions that will occur during the real speech. By training, you prepare
<br>yourself fully and will be ready for anything.
<br>Practice Emotional Mastery Techniques Daily
<br>Peak state training takes time. It’s not enough to do this just a few times. Ideally, you
<br>will do this training hundreds of times prior to every speech you ever give.
<br>Preparation and training are what make you a great speaker.
<br>You simply must practice daily in order to improve and master the fear of public
<br>speaking. It’s not easy, but it is highly rewarding. Public speaking mastery will open
<br>many opportunities. When you speak to an audience, you are able to reach tens,
<br>hundreds, or even thousands of people at a time. Your influence grows. As your
<br>influence grows, so too will your career.
<br>CHAPTER 22
<br>English Connects You With The World
<br>Think about why you are studying English. Chances are it has something to do
<br>with communicating or connecting with other people. English conversation is about
<br>connection. That is the purpose of English conversation – to connect with people
<br>around the world. We want to connect personally and emotionally. We want to
<br>connect with business partners, clients, and customers. We want to connect with
<br>professional peers. We want to connect with new friends.
<br>In short, you need a community to use English. As a learner, it’s especially useful
<br>to join a community of other English learners in order to practice and improve. The
<br>kind of community you join, however, is very important.
<br>Your peer group has a strong effect upon your ultimate success. A “peer group”
<br>is simply a group of people who are interconnected with each other. Your friends
<br>are a peer group. Your family is another peer group. If you join an English class in
<br>a school, your classmates become your peer group. When you join an online
<br>community of English learners, they become your peer group.
<br>Peer groups influence their members because, as a group, they share and promote
<br>certain values and behaviors. The group as a whole has certain standards and every
<br>member of the group is pulled towards those standards. This group effect can
<br>produce powerful positive or negative results.
<br>A negative peer group is one with generally low standards. These groups are
<br>typically characterized by frequent criticism, focus on errors, complaints, and even
<br>insults among members. Such a group tends to pull down its members,
<br>discouraging and distracting them from success. Sadly, such groups are especially
<br>common in schools and online – the two most common English learning
<br>environments.
<br>You want a peer group to pull you up. You want to join a group that encourages
<br>you, that feeds you positive thoughts, that interests and entertains you. You want a
<br>group that will boost you when you are struggling, and celebrate when you are
<br>successful.
<br>Peer groups create spirals, either upward or downward. Through their shared
<br>interactions, standards and values, peer group communities exert ever-increasing
<br>influence upon you. Participation in a toxic peer group will eventually erode your
<br>confidence, no matter how strong you are. On the positive side, an inspiring peer
<br>group will empower you to improve, grow, and achieve tremendous success, even
<br>if you now feel hopeless.
<br>Choose carefully. When considering a class or online English community,
<br>esearch it thoroughly. Notice how the members interact with each other. When a
<br>member is successful, are they celebrated, or do other members gossip jealously?
<br>When a community member struggles, do other members jump in to encourage and
<br>help them or are they ignored?
<br>While it seems obvious, many students forget the ultimate reason they are
<br>learning. In traditional English conversation classes it’s easy to get too focused on
<br>tests, textbooks, grades, and “levels.” After a while, you as a student are so worried
<br>about these artificial measurements that you forget your ultimate purpose for study.
<br>At the deepest level, English conversation is about international communitybuilding
<br>and sustaining meaningful connections between people. What kind of
<br>people do you want in your English speaking community?
<br>One of my ongoing goals is to use our seminars and courses and online groups
<br>as a way to create strong international communities. I want to help people connect
<br>and communicate in positive and meaningful ways – and help them stay connected.
<br>One way you can do this is through our member forums and conversation clubs.
<br>They’re designed to allow you to interact and ask questions of other students who
<br>are learning English just like you.
<br>I also want you to always keep in mind why you are studying English in the first
<br>place. Forget grades, tests and worrying about mistakes or how you might sound to
<br>others. Just focus on communicating and trying to connect with positive people.
<br>Surround yourself with enthusiastic people who love speaking English.
<br>The more you connect with people who are excited about English, the more
<br>excited you will become. Enthusiasm is contagious! So is negativity. Choose your
<br>peer group wisely.
<br>COMMUNITY IS IMPORTANT
<br>When learning anything, especially when learning English, it’s important to have a community – a club of other
<br>enthusiastic learners. This is why people continue to go to schools, even though they know the schools’ methods
<br>are terrible. People want a community. They want to join with other people. They want the increased motivation,
<br>support, and inspiration that a good community can provide.
<br>This is why our website is called the Effortless English Club™ (EffortlessEnglishClub.com). Effortless
<br>English™ is more than great courses – it’s also a community of very positive and enthusiastic learners. In fact, we
<br>are very careful about membership in our community. We only accept the most motivated – English learners who
<br>are very positive and enthusiastic.
<br>We monitor our club quite closely, and we have zero tolerance for the negative, insulting, or childish behavior
<br>usually seen in internet communities. On most internet forums, for example, you find a massive amount of insults
<br>and arguing. We don’t allow that. Such members are quickly and decisively eliminated from the club, and are
<br>never allowed to re-join.
<br>Yes, this is a tough policy. But it is necessary. It can be difficult to create a great international learning club
<br>online. And I admit – I am not interested in accepting and tolerating everyone. My goal is to create an
<br>international English learning club of only the most positive learners. I want the most enthusiastic, the most
<br>supportive, the friendliest, the most energetic members in the world… and that, in fact, is exactly what we have.
<br>The members of the Effortless English Club™ are absolutely amazing. The level of enthusiasm and
<br>friendliness is tremendous. New members are always very happy to discover such a fun and supportive learning
<br>club. We have many super members who will answer your questions, give you learning advice, encourage you
<br>when you feel discouraged, and inspire you with their success.
<br>We made that community even stronger when we launched our new VIP Program. For us, VIP stands for
<br>Vision, Inspiration, Persistence… a monthly membership site where the most dedicated members meet… and get
<br>new lessons from me every month. All lessons have video, audio and text, so you can understand everything…
<br>but more importantly, the lessons focus on three powerful topics: Advanced Learning Strategies, The Psychology
<br>of Success, and Positive Leadership.
<br>The VIP Member Program focuses not only on English, but also on Learning and Success in general. This is a
<br>place where our most motivated students (the top 1 percent) meet and learn together – a powerful club and
<br>community of the Best of the Best. They are the best not because of their starting English ability, but because of
<br>their positive attitudes, persistence, and devotion to learning.
<br>CHAPTER 23
<br>The Effortless English Code and Mission
<br>The Effortless English™ community is held together by our purpose, code,
<br>mission and values. Obviously, our main purpose is to help you speak English
<br>powerfully and correctly. We share, however, a deeper code, mission and values.
<br>It is the code, mission and values that have created our positive and enthusiastic
<br>community, with members from every continent of all ages, genders, and types of
<br>people. The code of Effortless English™ is our simple, three part code of conduct.
<br>All members of our community, upon joining, agree to follow the code.
<br>The Code of the Effortless English Club™ is:
<br>1. We Do The Best We Can
<br>2. We Do The Right Thing
<br>3. We Show Each Other We Care
<br>We do the best we can means that we try hard to improve but we know that
<br>perfection is impossible. We don’t worry about perfection. We don’t get upset about
<br>mistakes. Our focus is always on improvement, not “the one right answer.”
<br>We do the right thing means we do not lie, gossip, or insult other members. We
<br>treat each other as good friends and family members. We follow “the Golden Rule”
<br>by being kind and polite within our community.
<br>We show each other we care means we go beyond just avoiding negative
<br>behavior. Rather, we actively encourage and support other members. When another
<br>member is feeling bad, we encourage them. When another member succeeds, we
<br>cheer them, congratulate them, and compliment them sincerely. We are always
<br>looking for ways to help each other.
<br>In addition to mastering spoken English, our community shares a deeper mission.
<br>Our mission is:
<br>To explore new opportunities for growth,
<br>To bring confidence, vitality and happiness to people all over the world,
<br>To boldly go where we have never gone before.
<br>To explore new opportunities for growth means we are always looking for new
<br>ways to learn and improve. We are dedicated to lifelong learning. As we improve,
<br>we share our success with other people. We help others to feel stronger, more
<br>energetic and happier. We do this within the Effortless English Club™. We do this
<br>within our families. We do this anywhere we can. Finally, we strive to live boldly
<br>with open minds. We are eager to try new things, consider new ideas, and travel to
<br>new places. We have an adventurous attitude toward life.
<br>The mission is connected to our community values. We have seven values:
<br>1. Devotion to the Mission
<br>As members of the Effortless English™ community we all share the mission. The
<br>mission is something we do together, as a team, as an international family.
<br>2. Enthusiasm
<br>Enthusiasm is vital for success in any area of life. Enthusiasm generates peak
<br>emotion and fuels our learning engine. We consciously choose to develop our
<br>enthusiasm for learning and life.
<br>3. Constant and Never-Ending Improvement
<br>As our mission suggests, we are dedicated to constant and never-ending
<br>improvement. We know that big success is the result of small but consistent
<br>improvements. We know that learning makes life more interesting and enjoyable
<br>and we continue learning as long as we are alive.
<br>4. Contribution
<br>Personal success is important and so is sharing that success. As we improve, we
<br>focus on helping others do the same. We are delighted by the success of others in
<br>our community. We do our best to help others in whatever way we can.
<br>5. Self-Reliance
<br>Members of the Effortless English Club™ are independent learners. We do not
<br>wait for teachers, schools or experts to tell us what to do. We don’t wait for others
<br>to solve our problems. We take responsibility for our own lives and our own
<br>problems. We are proactive learners.
<br>6. Persistence
<br>Success is impossible without persistence. When something is important to us, we
<br>do not quit. Despite hardships, despite challenges, despite temporary failures, we
<br>keep going. We continue to move forward until we achieve our goals.
<br>7. Positive Leadership
<br>Every member of the Effortless English Club™ is a leader because each of us can
<br>encourage and inspire others. In our community, we lead by example. We don’t tell
<br>others what to do. Rather, we strive to be good role models. We work hard to show
<br>the way. As leaders, we want to make others stronger, more successful, and more
<br>confident.
<br>It is my belief that all schools should operate with such a code, mission and
<br>values. Many of the problems in education would be solved if teachers,
<br>administrators, and students were guided by the above principles.
<br>One of the great problems in schools is that teachers have failed to recognize they
<br>must do more than lecture to and discipline their students. Truly great teachers are
<br>more than just lecturers, they are leaders and coaches who inspire their students to
<br>greatness.
<br>Think of your favorite sports coach – someone who helped his or her team
<br>achieve greatness. These people do not simply teach the skills of the game. Great
<br>coaches lead and inspire. They are experts in practical psychology. They know how
<br>to energize and motivate their players. They make their teams stronger, more
<br>confident, and more successful.
<br>This is why I typically call myself an English “coach” rather than a teacher. The
<br>word “coach” reminds me to be more. It reminds me to focus on energizing,
<br>leading and inspiring my team members. As a coach, I must do more than simply
<br>teach English, I must help you believe in yourself. I must convince you that you can
<br>succeed with English, that, in fact, you will succeed.
<br>I hope this book has done exactly that. I hope you feel more confident. I hope you
<br>are convinced that you can and you will finally succeed with English speaking. The
<br>past does not equal the future. Whatever struggles you have had with English are
<br>gone. Let them go. Today is a new day and you now have a completely new system.
<br>Today is your day. You are now on your way to Effortless English™ speaking.
<br>Enjoy the journey! </p>
